		       -- README for the Test Suite --


I. Overview
~~~~~~~~~~~

The purpose of the "test suite" contained in this directory is to detect
bugs and incompatibilities in ngIRCd introduced during coding and after
building ngIRCd on a specific platform.

To run the "standard" tests call "make check". It will build ngIRCd (if
required) and run some tests on it. These tests should be portable and run
on all supported platforms without errors.

Please note: most tests of this suite depend on the external tools expect(1)
and telnet(1), so make sure you have them installed. If not, the tests will
not fail but simply be skipped.


II. Shell Scripts
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

getpid.sh <name>

	This script is used to detect the PID of the running process with
	the given name in a portable manner. The result is echoed on the
	console. It is a helper script for some other scripts of this suite.

start-server.sh

	start-server.sh starts up the test binary, "T-ngircd". It makes sure
	that getpid.sh is available and working, and that no other instance
	of the test binary is already running.
	The exit code is 0 if the test binary could be started.

stop-server.sh

	This script uses getpid.sh to detect a running test binary "T-ngircd"
	and then shuts it down using the TERM signal.
	The exit code is 0 if the test binary could be stopped.

stress-server.sh

	...

tests.sh

	...
