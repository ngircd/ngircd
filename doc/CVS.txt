               ngIRCd is free software and published under the
                   terms of the GNU General Public License.

                                 -- CVS.txt --


The source code of ngIRCd is maintained using the "Concurrent Versions
System" (CVS). Thereby several developers can work with the source tree at
the same time.


I. Anonymous read-only Access
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
To access the source tree anonymously in read-only mode, follow these steps:

Login to the CVS server:

 $ cvs -d:pserver:anonymous@arthur.ath.cx:/usr/local/CVS/ngircd login

Use "anonymous" as user name and no password (just hit Return). Now you can
check out the sources:

 $ cvs -d:pserver:anonymous@arthur.ath.cx:/usr/local/CVS/ngircd checkout ngircd

Thereby a new folder "ngircd" will be created containing all the individual
source files.

This is the "working folder", all CVS commands will be executed from within
this folder in the future.

Please note: When checking out a fresh copy of ngIRCd from CVS, the
configure script doesn't exist; you have to run the autogen.sh shell script
(which is included in the source tree) to generate it. This requires you to
have GNU automake and GNU autoconf installed on your system.

Updating the CVS tree:

 $ cvs update -d -P [<filename>]

You can update a single file or the complete source tree.


III. Write Access
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
If you want to contribute a couple of patches and write access to the CVS
repository would be handy, please contact Alex Barton, <alex@barton.de>.
