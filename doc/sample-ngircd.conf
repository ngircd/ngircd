[Global]

	# The [Global] section of this file is used to define the main
	# configuration of the server, like the server name and the ports
	# on which the server should be listening.
	
	# Server name in the IRC-network
	Name = irc.the.net
	
	# Info text of the server. This will be shown by WHOIS and
	# LINKS requests for example.
	Info = Server Info Text

	# Global password for all users needed to connect to the server
	;Password = abc
	
	# Information about the server and the administrator, used by the
	# ADMIN command.
	;AdminInfo1 = Description
	;AdminInfo2 = Location
	;AdminEMail = admin@irc.server
 
	# Ports on which the server should listen. There may be more than
	# one port, separated with ";". (Default: 6667)
	;Ports = 6667, 6668, 66694
	
	# Text file with the "message of the day" (MOTD). This message will
	# be shown to all users connecting to the server:
	;MotdFile = /usr/local/etc/ngircd.motd

	# User ID under which the server should run; you can use the name
	# of the user or the numerical ID. ATTENTION: For this to work the
	# server must have been started with root privileges! In addition,
	# the configuration and MOTD files must be readable by this user,
	# otherwise RESTART and REHASH won't work!
	;ServerUID = 65534

	# Group ID under which the ngircd should run; you can use the name
	# of the group or the numerical ID. ATTENTION: For this to work the
	# server must have been started with root privileges!
	;ServerGID = 65534

	# After <PingTimeout> seconds of inactivity the server will send a
	# PING to the peer to test whether it is alive or not.
	;PingTimeout = 120

	# If a client fails to answer a PING with a PONG within <PongTimeout>
	# seconds, it will be disconnected by the server.
	;PongTimeout = 20

	# The server tries every <ConnectRetry> seconds to establish a link
	# to not yet (or no longer) connected servers.
	;ConnectRetry = 60

	# Should IRC Operators be allowed to use the MODE command even if
	# they are not(!) channel-operators?
	;OperCanUseMode = no

	# Maximum number of simultaneous connection the server is allowed
	# to accept (<=0: unlimited):
	;MaxConnections = -1

[Operator]
	# [Operator] sections are used to define IRC Operators. There may be
	# more than one [Operator] block, one for each local operator.
	
	# ID of the operator (may be different of the nick name)
	;Name = TheOper

	# Password of the IRC operator
	;Password = ThePwd

[Server]
	# Other servers are configured in [Server] sections. If you
	# configure a port for the connection, then this ngircd tries to
	# connect to to the other server on the given port; if not it waits
	# for the other server to connect.
	# There may be more than one server block.
	#
	# Server Groups:
	# The ngIRCd allows "server groups": You can assign an "ID" to every
	# server with which you want this ngIRCd to link. If a server of a
	# group won't answer, the ngIRCd tries to connect to the next server
	# in the given group. But the ngircd never tries to connect to two
	# servers with the same group ID.
	
	# IRC name of the server
	;Name = irc2.the.net
   
	# Internet host name of the peer
	;Host = connect-to-host.the.net

	# Port of the server to which the ngIRCd should connect. If you
	# assign no port the ngIRCd waits for incoming connections.
	;Port = 6666

	# Own password for the connection. This password has to be configured
	# as "PeerPassword" on the other server.
	;MyPassword = MySecret

	# Foreign password for this connection. This password has to be
	# configured as "MyPassword" on the other server.
	;PeerPassword = PeerSecret
	
	# Group of this server (optional)
	;Group = 123

[Channel]
	# Pre-defined channels can be configured in [Channel] sections.
	# Such channels are created by the server when starting up and even
	# persist when there are no more members left.
	# Persistent channels are marked with the mode 'P', which can be set
	# and unset by IRC operators like other modes on the fly.
	# There may be more than one [Channel] block.
	
	# Name of the channel
	;Name = #TheName

	# Topic for this channel
	;Topic = a great topic
	
	# Initial channel modes
	;Modes = tn
