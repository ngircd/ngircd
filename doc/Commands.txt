               ngIRCd is free software and published under the
                   terms of the GNU General Public License.

                              -- Commands.txt --


This file lists all commands available on ngIRCd. It is written in a format
that is human readable as well as machine parseable and therefore can be used
as "help text file" of the daemon.

In short, the daemon reads this file on startup and parses it as following
when an user issues a "HELP <cmd>" command:

 1. Search the file for a line "- <cmd>",
 2. Output all subsequent lines that start with a TAB (ASCII 9) character
    to the client using NOTICE commands, treat lines containing a single "."
    after the TAB as empty lines.
 3. Break at the first line not starting with a TAB character.

This format allows to have information to each command stored in this file
which will not be sent to an IRC user requesting help which enables us to
have additional annotations stored here which further describe the origin,
implementation details, or limits of the specific command which are not
relevant to an end-user but administrators and developers.

A special "Intro" block is returned to the user when the HELP command is
used without a command name:


- Intro
	This is ngIRCd, a server software for Internet Relay Chat (IRC)
	networks. You can find more information about ngIRCd on its homepage:
		<http://ngircd.barton.de>
	.
	Use "HELP COMMANDS" to get a list of all available commands and
	"HELP <command-name>" to get help for a specific IRC command, for
	example "HELP quit" or "HELP privmsg".


Connection Handling Commands
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- CAP
	CAP LS
	CAP LIST
	CAP REQ <capabilities>
	CAP ACK <capabilities>
	CAP NAK <capabilities>
	CAP CLEAR
	CAP END
	.
	List, request, and clear "IRC Capabilities".
	.
	Using this command, an IRC client can request additional "IRC
	capabilities" during login or later on, which influences the
	communication between server and client. Normally, these commands
	aren't directly used by humans, but automatically by their client
	software. And please note that issuing such commands manually can
	irritate the client software used, because of the "non-standard"
	behavior of the server!
	.
	- CAP LS: list all available capabilities.
	- CAP LIST: list active capabilities of this connection.
	- CAP REQ: Request particular capabilities.
	- CAP ACK: Acknowledge a set of capabilities to be enabled/disabled.
	- CAP NAK: Reject a set of capabilities.
	- CAP CLEAR: Clear all set capabilities.
	- CAP END: Indicate end of capability negotiation during login,
	  ignored in an fully registered session.

	Please note that the <capabilities> must be given in a single
	parameter but whitespace separated, therefore a command could look
	like this: "CAP REQ :capability1 capability2 capability3" for example.

	 - <http://ircv3.atheme.org/specification/capability-negotiation-3.1>
	 - <http://ngircd.barton.de/doc/Capabilities.txt>
	 - doc/Capabilities.txt

- CHARCONV
	CHARCONV <client-charset>
	.
	Set client character set encoding to <client-charset>.
	.
	After receiving such a command, the server translates all message
	data received from the client using the set <client-charset> to the
	server encoding (UTF-8), and all message data which is to be sent to
	the client from the server encoding (UTF-8) to <client-charset>.
	.
	This enables older clients and clients using "strange" character sets
	to transparently participate in channels and direct messages to
	clients using UTF-8, which should be the default today.

	References:
	 - <http://ngircd.barton.de/doc/Protocol.txt>
	 - doc/Protocol.txt

- NICK
	NICK <nick>
	.
	Change your nickname to <nick>.

- PASS
	PASS <password> <version> <flags> [<options>]
	.
	Set a connection <password>. This command must be sent before the
	NICK/USER registration combination.
	.
	See doc/Protocol.txt for more info.

- PING
	PING <server1> [<server2>]
	.
	Tests the presence of a connection. A PING message results in a PONG
	reply. If <server2> is specified, the message gets passed on to it.

- PONG
	PONG <server1> [<server2>]
	.
	This command is a reply to the PING command and works in much the
	same way.

- QUIT
	QUIT [<quit-message>]
	.
	End IRC session and disconnect from the server.
	.
	If a <quit-message> has been given, it is displayed to all the
	channels that you are a member of when leaving.

- USER
	USER <user> <modes> <realname>
	.
	This command is used at the beginning of a connection to specify the
	<user>name, hostname, <realname> and initial user <modes> of the
	connecting client.
	.
	<realname> may contain spaces, and thus must be prefixed with a colon.

- WEBIRC
	See doc/Protocol.txt


General Commands
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- AWAY
	AWAY [<message>]
	.
	Provides the server with a message to automatically send in reply to a
	PRIVMSG directed at the user, but not to a channel they are on.
	.
	If <message> is omitted, the away status is removed.

- HELP
	HELP [<command>]
	.
	Show help information for a specific IRC <command>. The <command> name
	is case-insensitive.
	.
	Use the command "HELP Commands" to get a list of all available commands.

	The HELP command isn't specified by any RFC but implemented by most
	daemons. If no help text could be read in, ngIRCd outputs a list of all
	implemented commands when receiving a plain "HELP" command as well as
	on "HELP Commands".

	ngIRCd replies using "NOTICE" commands like ircd 2.10/2.11; other
	implementations are using numerics 704, 705, and 706.


- MODE
	MODE <nickname> <flags> (user)
	MODE <channel> <flags> [<args>]
	.
	The MODE command is dual-purpose. It can be used to set both (user) and
	<channel> modes.
	.
	See doc/Modes.txt for more information.

- NOTICE
	NOTICE <target> <notice>
	.
	Send <notice> to <target> (nick or channel).
	.
	This command works similarly to PRIVMSG, except automatic replies must
	never be sent in reply to NOTICE messages.

- PRIVMSG
	PRIVMSG <target> <message>
	.
	Send <message> to <target> (nick or channel).
	.
	Common IRC clients use MSG as PRIVMSG alias.
	(Some clients use "QUERY <nick> [<message>]" to open a private chat.)


Status and Informational Commands
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- ADMIN
	ADMIN [<target>]
	.
	Show administrative information about an IRC server in the network.
	.
	<target> can be a server name, the nickname of a client connected to
	a specific server, or a mask matching a server name in the network.
	The server of the current connecion is used when <target> is omitted.

	References:
	 - RFC 2812, 3.4.9 "Admin command"

- INFO
	INFO [<target>]
	.
	Show the version, birth & online time of an IRC server in the network.
	.
	<target> can be a server name, the nickname of a client connected to

	References:
	 - RFC 2812, 3.4.10 "Info command"

- ISON
	ISON <nickname> [<nickname> [...]]
	.
	Query online status of a list of nicknames. The server replies with
	a list only containing nicknes actually connected to a server in
	the network. If no nicknames of the given list are online, an empty
	list is returned to the client requesting the information.

	Please note that "all" IRC daemons even parse separate nicknames in
	a single parameter (like ":nick1 nick2"), and therefore ngIRCd
	implements this behaviour, too.

	References:
	 - RFC 2812, 4.9 "Ison message"

- LINKS
	LINKS [[<target>] [<mask>]
	.
	List all servers currently registered in the network matching <mask>,

	.
	<target> can be a server name, the nickname of a client connected to
	a specific server, or a mask matching a server name in the network.
	The server of the current connecion is used when <target> is omitted.

	.
	If <channel> has been omitted, all visible users are shown, grouped
	by channel name, and all visible users not being members of at least
	one channel are shown as members of the pseudo channel "*".

	 - g  Network-wide bans ("G-Lines").
	 - k  Server-local bans ("K-Lines").
	 - l  Link status (parent server and own link only).

	(".", for example "ngIRCd-20.1."). If it ends in ".1" (for example
	"ngIRCd-20.1.1", same version than before!), the server is running in

	.
	To connect <remote server> you need to have remote oper status.
