ngIRCd 27 (2024-04-26)

  - Add an example filter file for "Fail2Ban": contrib/ngircd-fail2ban.conf.

  ngIRCd 27~rc1 (2024-04-13)
  - Validate certificates on server links. Up to now, ngIRCd optionally used
    SSL/TLS encrypted server-server links but never checked and validated any
    certificates. Now ngIRCd validates SSL/TLS certificates on outgoing
    server-server links by default and drops(!) connections when the remote
    certificate is invalid (for example self-signed, expired, not matching the
    host name, ...). Therefore you have to make sure that all relevant
    *certificates are valid* (or to disable certificate validation on this
    connection using the new `SSLVerify = false` setting in the affected
    `[Server]` block, where the remote certificate is not valid and you can not
    fix this issue).
    The original patch for OpenSSL dates back to 2009 and was written by Florian
    Westphal and was extended for GnuTLS in 2014 by Christoph Biedl. But it took
    us another 10 years to bring it to life ... oh my! Many thanks to both
    Florian and Christoph!
    Closes #120.
  - Add support for the "sd_notify" protocol of systemd(8): Periodically
    "ping" the service manager (every 3 seconds) and set a status message
    showing current connection statistics which then is included in "systemctl
    status ngircd.service" output. In addition, this enables using the
    systemd(8) watchdog functionality ("WatchdogSec") for the "ngircd.service"
    unit and allows it to use the "notify" service type, which results in
    better status tracking by the service manager.
  - Try to set file descriptor limit to its maximum and show info on startup:
    The number of possible parallel connections is limited by the file
    descriptor limit of the process (among other things). Therefore try to
    upgrade the current "soft" limit to its "hard" maximum (but limited to
    100000 instead of "infinite"), and show an information or even warning when
    the limit is still less than the configured "MaxConnections" setting. Please
    note that ngIRCd and its linked libraries (like PAM) need file descriptors
    not only for incoming and outgoing IRC connections, but for reading files
    and inter-process communication, too! Therefore the actual connection limit
    is less(!) than the file descriptor limit!
  - Add a "Docker file" (contrib/Dockerfile) and corresponding documentation
    (doc/Container.md) to the project. The resulting container is based on the
    latest Debian "stable-slim" container and built using a "build container".
  - No longer use a default built-in value for the "IncludeDir" directive when
    a configuration file was explicitly specified on the command line using
    "--config"/"-f": This way no default include directory is scanned when a
    possibly non-default configuration file is used which (intentionally) did
    not specify an "IncludeDir" directive. So now you can use "-f /dev/null"
    for checking all built-in defaults, regardless of any local configuration
    files in the default drop-in directory (which would have been read in
    until this change).
  - The server "Name" in the "[Global]" section of the configuration file no
    longer needs to be set: When not set (or empty), ngIRCd now tries to
    deduce a valid IRC server name from the local host name ("node name"),
    possibly adding a ".host" extension when the host name does not contain a
    dot (".") which is required in an IRC server name ("ID").
    This new behavior, with all configuration parameters now being optional,
    allows running ngIRCd without any configuration file at all.
  - Autodetect support for IPv6 by default: Until now, IPv6 support was disabled
    by default, which seems a bit outdated in 2024. Note: You still can pass
    "--enable-ipv6"/"--disable-ipv6" to the ./configure script to forcefully
    activate or deactivate IPv6 support.
  - Do IDENT requests even when DNS lookups are disabled: Up to now disabling
    DNS in the configuration disabled IDENT lookups as well (for no good
    reason). Now you can activate/deactivate DNS lookups and IDENT requests
    completely separately. Thanks for reporting this, Miniontoby!
    Closes #291.
  - Allow SSL client-only configurations without keys/certificates: You don't
    need to configure certificates/keys as long as you don't configure
    SSL-enabled listening ports. This can make sense when you want to only link
    your local daemon to an uplink server using SSL and only have clients on
    your local host or in your fully trusted network, where SSL is not required.
  - Respect "SSLConnect" option for incoming connections and do not accept
    incoming plain-text ("non SSL") server connections for servers configured
    with "SSLConnect" enabled. This change prevents an authenticated
    client-server being able to force the server-server to send its password
    on a plain-text connection when SSL/TLS was intended.
  - Add a new option "Autojoin" to [Channel] blocks: When it is set, ngIRCd
    automatically joins all local users to this channel on connect. Note: The
    users must have permissions to access the channel, otherwise joining them
    will fail!
    Thanks Ivan Agarkov <i_agarkov@wargaming.net> for the initial patch!
  - Hide invisible (+i) users on "WHOIS <pattern>": Let's behave like most(?)
    other IRC daemons (at least ircd2.11) and hide all +i users when WHOIS is
    used with a pattern. Otherwise privacy of this users is not guaranteed and
    the +i mode a bit useless ...
    Reported by Cahata on #ngircd, thanks!
  - Make the debug log level ("--debug"/-"d" command line option) always
    available, not only when ./configure'd with "--enable-debug": the latter
    now only enables additional checks (like the tests done using assert(2))
    and is signalled by adding "+DEBUG" to the version "feature string". This
    change enables everyone to get even more detailed logging when required.
  - Allow IRC Operators to use the WHO command on any channel.
  - Send the NAMES list and channel topic to users "forcefully" joined to a
    channel using NJOIN, like they joined on their own using JOIN, and
    streamline the order of NAMES list and channel topic messages.
    Closes #288.
  - Added a new command line option "-y"/"--syslog", with which logging to
    syslog can be activated/deactivated separately from running on the console
    (using "--nodaemon") or in the background.
    Thanks Katherine Peeters for the patch and pull request!
    Closes #294.
  - Update, enhance and extend our documentation in README.md, INSTALL.md,
    doc/HowToRelease.txt and the manual pages ngircd(8) and ngircd.conf(5), add
    a new doc/QuickStart.md document, and convert some more documentation files
    to Markdown (AUTHORS.md, contrib/README.md, doc/FAQ.md, doc/SSL.md).

ngIRCd 26.1 (2021-01-02)

  - This release is a bugfix release only, without new features.

ngIRCd 26 (2020-06-20)

  ngIRCd 26~rc2 (2020-06-11)
  - Add AppStream metadata file (contrib/de.barton.ngircd.metainfo.xml).
  - Various bug fixes, see the ChangeLog. No new or changed functionality.

  ngIRCd 26~rc1 (2020-05-10)
  - Allow up to 512 characters per line in MOTD and help text files (but keep
    in mind that lines can't get that long, because they have to be prefixed
    before being sent to the client). But this allows for more fancy MOTDs :-)
    Closes #271.
  - Show the actually allowed channel types in the ISUPPORT(005) numeric which
    are configured by the "AllowedChannelTypes" configuration variable.
    Closes #273.
  - Handle commands in the read buffer before reading more data and don't wait
    for the network in this case: If there are more bytes in the read buffer
    already than a single valid IRC command can get long (513 bytes), wait for
    this/those command(s) to be handled first and don't try to read even more
    data from the network (which most probably would overflow the read buffer
    of this connection soon).
  - Log G-/K-Line changes only when not initiated by a server: this prevents
    the log from becoming spammed during "net bursts".
  - Update test suite to include SSL tests, including checking for reloading
    certificates during runtime.
  - Add support for GnuTLS certificate reload, which is quite handy when using
    Let's Encrypt, for example. Until now this was only supported when linked
    with OpenSSL. Thanks a lot, Hilko Bengen <bengen@hilluzination.de>!
  - Allow setting arbitrary channel modes in the configuration file by handling
    them like in MODE commands, and allow multiple "Modes =" lines per [Channel]
    section. Thanks to Michi <michi+ngircd@dataswamp.org>!
    Closes #55.
  - Add "FNC" (forced nick changes) to ISUPPORT(005) numeric. Most probably
    this doesn't make any difference to any client, but it seems correct.
    See <http://www.irc.org/tech_docs/005.html> for details.
  - Enhance handling of command line errors, and return with exit code 0 ("no
    error") when "--help" or "--version" is used (which resulted in exit code 1,
    "error" before). Exit with code 2 ("command line error") for all other
    invalid command line options, and show the error message itself on stderr
    (instead of stdout and exit code 1, "generic error", as before).
    This new behavior is more in line with the GNU "coding standards",
    see <https://www.gnu.org/prep/standards/html_node/_002d_002dhelp.html>.
  - Add ./contrib/nglog.sh: This script parses the log output of ngircd(8),
    and colorizes the messages according to their log level. Example usage:
    ngircd -f $PWD/doc/sample-ngircd.conf -np | ./contrib/nglog.sh
  - Enlarge buffers of info texts to 128 bytes. This includes:
    - "Real name" of a client (4th filed of the USER command).
    - Server info text ("Info" configuration option).
    - Admin info texts and email address ("AdminInfo1", "AdminInfo2" and
      "AdminEmail" configuration options).
    - Network name ("Network" configuration option).
    The limit was 64 bytes before ...
    Closes #258.
  - Streamline handling of invalid and unset server name: Don't exit during
    runtime (REHASH command, HUP signal), because the server name can't be
    changed in this case anyway and the new invalid name will be ignored.
  - Slightly reorder startup steps, and enhance logging:
    - Show name of configuration file at the beginning of start up.
    - Add a message when ngIRCd is ready, including its host name.
    - Show name of configuration file on REHASH (SIGHUP), too.
    - Change level of "done message" to NOTICE, like "starting" & "ready".
    - Initialize IO functions before channels, connections, clients, ...
  - configure.ng: OpenSSL can depends on lz or latomic so use pkg-config to
    find those dependencies and fallback to existing mechanism.
    Closes #256.

ngIRCd 25 (2019-01-23)

  - Implement new configuration option "MaxPenaltyTime", which configures the
    maximum penalty time increase in seconds, per penalty event. Set to -1 for
    no limit (the default), 0 to disable penalties altogether. ngIRCd doesn't
    use penalty increases higher than 2 seconds during normal operation, so
    values higher than 1 rarely make sense.
    Disabling (or reducing) penalties can greatly speed up "make check" runs
    for example, see below, but are mostly a debugging feature and normally
    not meant to be used on production systems!
    Some example timings running "make check" from my macOS workstation:
     - MaxPenaltyTime not set: 4:41,79s
     - "MaxPenaltyTime = 1":   3:14,71s
     - "MaxPenaltyTime = 0":     25,46s
    Closes #249 and #251.
  - Update Xcode project for latest Xcode version (10.0)
  - Allow a 5th parameter in WEBIRC. Thanks to "ItsOnlyBinary".
    Closes #247.

  ngIRCd 25~rc1 (2018-08-11)
  - Only send TOPIC updates to a channel when the topic actually changed:
    This prevents the channel from becoming flooded by unnecessary TOPIC update
    messages, that can happen when IRC services try to enforce a certain topic
    but which is already set (at least on the local server), for example.
    Therefore still forward it to all servers, but don't inform local clients
    (still update setter and timestamp information, though!).
  - Update Xcode project for latest Xcode version (9.2). This includes adding
    missing and deleting obsolete file references.
  - Handle user mode "C" ("Only users that share a channel are allowed to send
    messages") like user mode "b" ("block private messages and notices"): allow
    messages from servers, services, and IRC Operators, too. Change proposed by
    "wowaname" back in 2015 in #ngircd, thanks!
  - Allow IRC Ops and remote servers to KILL service clients: such clients
    behave like regular users, therefore IRC operators and servers should be
    able to KILL them: for example to resolve nick collisions.
    Closes #242.

ngIRCd 24 (2017-01-20)

  ngIRCd 24~rc1 (2017-01-07)
  - Log privilege violations and failed OPER request with log level "error"
    and send it to the "&SERVER" channel, too.
  - Immediately shut down connection when receiving an "ERROR" command,
    don't wait for the peer to close the connection. This allows the daemon
    to forward the received "ERROR" message in the network, instead of the
    very generic "client closed connection" message.
  - Explicitly forbid remote servers to modify "x-lines" (G-LINES) when the
    "AllowRemoteOper" configuration option isn't set, even when the command
    seems to originate from the remote server itself: this prevents GLINE's
    to become set during server handshake in this case (what wouldn't be
    possible during regular runtime when a remote IRC Op sends the command)
    and what can't be undone by IRC Ops later on (because of the missing
    "AllowRemoteOper" option) ...
  - Update Xcode project for latest Xcode version (8.0), and fix "duplicate
    symbols" error messages when building (linking) the binary.
  - Add "Documentation" variables to systemd configuration files.
  - Make sure that SYSCONFDIR is always set, which can be handy when
    using source code linters when ./configure hasn't been run already.
  - Add the new "PAMServiceName" configuration option to specify the name
    used as PAM service name. This setting allows to run multiple ngIRCd
    instances with different PAM configurations for each instance.
    Thanks to Christian Aistleitner <christian@quelltextlich.at> for the
    patch, closes #226.
  - Add an ".editorconfig" file to the project.
  - Limit the number of message target, and suppress duplicates: This
    prevents an user from flooding the server using commands like this:
    "PRIVMSG nick1,nick1,nick1,...".
    Duplicate targets are suppressed silently (channels and clients).
    In addition, the maximum number of targets per PRIVMSG, NOTICE, ...
    command are limited to MAX_HNDL_TARGETS (25). If there are more, the
    daemon sends the new 407 (ERR_TOOMANYTARGETS_MSG) numeric, containing
    the first target that hasn't been handled any more. Closes #187.
  - Make contrib/platformtest.sh script more portable, and only show
    "runs=Y" when the test suite really has been passed successfully.

ngIRCd 23 (2015-11-16)

  ngIRCd 23~rc1 (2015-09-06)
  - Use "NOTICE *" before registration instead of "NOTICE AUTH". "AUTH" is
    a valid nickname so sending notices to it is probably not a good idea.
    Use "*" as the target instead as done with numerics when the nick is not
    available. This mimics the behavior in Charybdis, IRCD-Hybrid, InspIRCd
    2.2, Plexus 4, etc. Closes #217.
    The "NoticeAuth" configuration variable (ngircd.conf) has been renamed
    to "NoticeBeforeRegistration" accordingly, but the old name is still
    supported for compatibility reasons.
  - Implement new channel mode "N" (regular users can't change their nick
    name while on this channel). Closes #214.
  - Keep track of who placed bans, invites, and excepts.
    Idea and implementation by LucentW, Thanks! Closes #203.
  - Implement numeric RPL_LISTSTART(321). lightIRC and other clients
    expecting RPL_LISTSTART should now behave correctly.
    Idea and implementation by LucentW, Thanks! Closes #207.
  - Streamline the effect of "MorePrivacy" option: Update documentation
    in ngircd.conf(5); don't hide channels for IRC Ops on LIST and don't
    hide IP addresses/hostnames on WHOIS when "MorePrivacy" is in effect.
    This closes #198.
  - IRC operators now can kick anyone when "OperCanMode" is set.
    Idea and implementation by LucentW, Thanks! Closes #202.
  - Implement user mode "I": Hide channels on WHOIS: this mode prevents
    ngIRCd from showing channels on WHOIS (IRC Operators can always see
    the channel list).
    Idea and implementation by LucentW, Thanks! Closes #197.
  - INVITE command: Implement ERR_USERNOTONSERV(504) numeric and make sure
    that the target user is on the same server when inviting other users
    to local ("&") channels.
    Idea by Cahata, thanks! Closes #183.
  - MODE command: Always report channel creation time. Up to now when
    receiving a MODE command, ngIRCd only reported the channel creation
    time to clients that were members of the channel. This patch reports
    the channel creation time to all clients, regardless if they are joined
    to that channel or not. At least ircd-seven behaves like this.
    This closes #188. Reported by Cahata, thanks!

ngIRCd 22.1 (2015-04-06)

  - Update "CipherList" to not enable SSLv3 by default. Idea, initial patch,
    and testing by Christoph Biedl <ngircd.anoy@manchmal.in-ulm.de>.
  - Change ngIRCd test suite not to use DNS lookups: Different operating
    systems do behave quite differently when doing DNS lookups, for example
    "127.0.0.1" sometimes resolves to "localhost" and sometimes to
    "localhost.localdomain" (for example OpenBSD). And other OS resolve
    "localhost" to the real host name (for example Cygwin). So not using
    DNS at all makes the test site much more portable.

ngIRCd 22 (2014-10-11)

  - Match all list patterns case-insensitive: this affects the invite-,
    ban-, and except lists, as well as G-Lines an K-Lines.
    Problem pointed out by "wowaname" on #ngircd, thanks!

  ngIRCd 22~rc1 (2014-09-29)
  - Sync "except lists" between servers: Up to now, ban, invite, and G-Line
    lists have been synced between servers while linking -- but obviously
    nobody noticed that except list have been missing ever since. Until now.
    Thanks to "j4jackj", who reported this issue in #ngircd.
  - Allow longer user names (up to 63 characters) for authentication.
  - Increase MAX_SERVERS from 16 to 64: There are installations out there
    that would like to configure more than 16 links per server, so increase
    this limit. Best would be to get rid of MAX_SERVERS altogether and make
    if fully dynamic, but start with this quick and dirty hack ...
  - Test suite/platformtest.sh: Detect when tests have been skipped.
  - Allow "DefaultUserModes" to set all possible modes, including modes only
    settable by IRC Operators.
  - Implement user mode "F": "relaxed flood protection". Clients with mode
    "F" set are allowed to rapidly send data to the daemon. This mode is only
    settable by IRC Operators and can cause problems in the network -- so be
    careful and only set it on "trusted" clients!
    User mode "F" is used by Bahamut for this purpose, for example.
  - Use server password when PAM is compiled in but disabled.
  - Streamline punctuation of log messages.
  - Return ISUPPORT(005) numerics on "VERSION". This is how ircd-seven,
    Charybdis, Hybrid, and InspIRCd behave, for example.
  - configure: Only link "contrib/Debian" if it exists, which isn't the case
    on "VPATH builds", for example.
  - Show the account name in WHOIS. This uses the same numeric as Charybdis
    and ircu families: WHOISLOGGEDIN(330).
  - Pattern matching: Remove "range matching" in our pattern matching code
    using the "[...]" syntax, because [ and ] are valid characters in nick
    names and one has to quote them currently using the "\" character, which
    is quite unexpected for users.
  - platformtest.sh: New option "-x", don't regenerate build system and
    allow using separate source and build trees.
  - Test suite: explicitly enable glibc memory checking.
  - Make "MODE -k" handling more robust and compatible, send "fake '*' key"
    in all replies.
  - portabtest: Actually test the functions snprintf(), strlcpy(), strlcat(),
    and vsnprintf() for correctness, not only existence (which was quite
    useless, because if they weren't available, the program could not have
    been linked at all ...).
  - Implement new configuration option "Network": it is used to set the
    (completely optional) "network name", to which this instance of the
    daemon belongs. When set, this name is used in the ISUPPORT(005) numeric
    which is sent to all clients connecting to the server after logging in.
  - Update doc/Platforms.txt.
  - Various code cleanups, remove unused code, streamline error handling.
    Remove all imp.h and exp.h header files, support non-standard vsnprintf()
    return codes, and fix some K&R C portability issues. Streamline
    DEBUG_ARRAY, DEBUG_BUFFER, DEBUG_IO, DEBUG_ZIP definitions.
  - Increase penalty time to 10 seconds when handling OPER commands with an
    invalid password.

ngIRCd 21.1 (2014-03-25)

  - Don't ignore but use the server password when PAM is compiled in but
    disabled. Thanks to Roy Sindre Norangshol <roy.sindre@norangshol.no>!
  - doc/Platforms.txt: Update from master branch.
  - doc/Services.txt: Update information for Anope 2.x.
  - configure: add support for the LDFLAGS_END and LIBS_END variables to add
    linker flags and libraries at the end of the configure run (CFLAGS_END has
    been implemented already).
  - Update Copyright notices for 2014 :-)

ngIRCd 21 (2013-10-30)

  - Call arc4random_stir() in forked subprocesses, when available. This
    is required by FreeBSD <10 and current NetBSD at least to correctly
    initialize the "arc4" random number generator on these platforms.

  ngIRCd 21~rc2 (2013-10-20)
  - Report the correct configuration file name on configuration errors,
    support longer configuration lines, and warn when lines are truncated.

  ngIRCd 21~rc1 (2013-10-05)
  - Actually KILL clients on GLINE/KLINE. (Closes bug #156)
  - Add support to show all user links using the "STATS L" (uppercase)
    command (restricted to IRC Operators).
  - Implement configurable SSL cipher list selection for GnuTLS and OpenSSL
    using the new configuration option "CipherList". In addition, this
    changes the defaults to more secure values: "HIGH:!aNULL:@STRENGTH" for
    OpenSSL, and "SECURE128" for GnuTLS.
  - Show connection flag "s" (SSL) in RPL_TRACE{LINK|SERVER} messages: now
    you can check if a server-to-server link is SSL-encrypted or not using
    the IRC "TRACE" command.
  - Implement the new configuration option "DefaultUserModes" which lists
    user modes that become automatically set on new local clients right
    after login. Please note that only modes can be set that the client
    could set on itself, so you can't set "a" (away) or "o" (IRC Op),
    for example! User modes "i" (invisible) or "x" (cloaked) etc. are
    "interesting", though. (Closes bug #160)
  - Add support for the new METADATA "account" property, which allows
    services to automatically identify users after netsplits and across
    service restarts.
  - Implement a new configuration option "AllowedChannelTypes" that lists
    all allowed channel types (channel prefixes) for newly created channels
    on the local server. By default, all supported channel types are allowed.
    If set to the empty string, local clients can't create new channels at
    all, which equals the old "PredefChannelsOnly = yes" setting.
    This change deprecates the "PredefChannelsOnly" variable, too, but it is
    still supported and translated to the appropriate "AllowedChannelTypes"
    setting. When the old "PredefChannelsOnly" variable is processed, a
    warning message is logged. (Closes bug #152)
  - Add support for "client certificate fingerprinting". When a client
    passes an SSL certificate to the server, the "fingerprint" will be
    forwarded in the network which enables IRC services to identify the
    user using this certificate and not using passwords.
  - Implement a new configuration option "IncludeDir" in the "[Options]"
    section that can be used to specify a directory which can contain
    further configuration files and configuration file snippets matching
    the pattern "*.conf". These files are read in after the main server
    configuration file ("ngircd.conf" by default) has been read in and
    parsed.  The default is "$SYSCONFDIR/ngircd.conf.d", so that it is
    possible to adjust the configuration only by placing additional files
    into this directory. (Closes bug #157)
  - Add Travis-CI configuration file (".travis.yml") to project.
  - ngIRCd now accepts user names including "@" characters, saves the
    unmodified name for authentication but stores only the part in front
    of the "@" character as "IRC user name". And the latter is how
    ircd2.11, Bahamut, and irc-seven behave as well. (Closes bug #155)
  - Lots of IRC "information functions" like ADMIN, INFO, ... now accept
    server masks and names of connected users (in addition to server names)
    for specifying the target server of the command. (Closes bug #153)
  - Implement a new configuration option "IdleTimeout" in the "[Limits]"
    section of the configuration file which can be used to set a timeout
    in seconds after which the whole daemon will shutdown when no more
    connections are left active after handling at least one client.
    The default is 0, "never".
    This can be useful for testing or when ngIRCd is started using "socket
    activation" with systemd(8), for example.
  - Implement support for systemd(8) "socket activation".
  - Enable WHOIS to display information about IRC Services using the new
    numeric 310(RPL_WHOISSERVICE) This numeric is used for this purpose by
    InspIRCd, for example -- but as usual, other numerics are in use, too,
    like 613 in UltimateIRCd ...
    Please note that neither the Operator (+o) not the "bot status" (+B)
    of an IRC service is displayed in the output.
  - Update systemd(8) example configuration files in ./contrib/ directory:
    the "ngircd.service" file now uses the "forking" service type which
    enhances the log messages shown by "systemctl status ngircd.service",
    and the new "ngircd.socket" file configures a systemd socket that
    configures a socket for ngIRCd and launches the daemon on demand.
  - Enhance help system and the HELP command: now a "help text file" can be
    set using the new configuration option "HelpFile" ("global" section),
    which is read in and parsed on server startup and configuration reload,
    and then is used to output individual help texts to specific topics.
    Please see the file ./doc/Commands.txt for details.

ngIRCd 20.3 (2013-08-23)

  - This release is a bugfix release only, without new features.
  - Security: Fix a denial of service bug (server crash) which could happen
    when the configuration option "NoticeAuth" is enabled (which is NOT the
    default) and ngIRCd failed to send the "notice auth" messages to new
    clients connecting to the server (CVE-2013-5580).

ngIRCd 20.2 (2013-02-15)

  - This release is a bugfix release only, without new features.
  - Security: Fix a denial of service bug in the function handling KICK
    commands that could be used by arbitrary users to crash the daemon
    (CVE-2013-1747).

ngIRCd 20.1 (2013-01-02)

  - This release is a bugfix release only, without new features.

ngIRCd 20 (2012-12-17)

  - Allow user names ("INDENT") up to 20 characters when ngIRCd has not
    been configured for "strict RFC mode". This is useful if you are using
    external (PAM) authentication mechanisms that require longer user names.
    Patch suggested by Brett Smith <brett@w3.org>, see
    <http://arthur.barton.de/pipermail/ngircd-ml/2012-October/000579.html>.

  ngIRCd 20~rc2 (2012-12-02)
  - Rework cloaked hostname handling and implement the "METADATA cloakhost"
    subcommand: Now ngIRCd uses two fields internally, one to store the
    "real" hostname and one to save the "cloaked" hostname. This allows
    "foreign servers" (aka "IRC services") to alter the real and cloaked
    hostnames of clients without problems, even when the user itself issues
    additional "MODE +x" and "MODE -x" commands.

  ngIRCd 20~rc1 (2012-11-11)
  - Update doc/Services.txt: describe the upcoming version of Anope 1.9.8,
    then including a protocol module for ngIRCd. And remove our own patches
    in ./contrib/Anope because they aren't supported any more ...
  - Implement new "METADATA" command which can be used by remote servers
    and IRC services to update client metadata like the client info text
    ("real name"), user name, and hostname, and use this command to
    configure an cloaked hostname (user mode "+x") on remote servers:
    This prevents "double cloaking" of hostnames and even cloaked
    hostnames are in sync on all servers supporting "METADATA" now.
  - Implement new IRC "SVSNICK" command to allow remote servers (and IRC
    services) to change nicknames of already registered users. The SVSNICK
    command itself doesn't change the nickname, but it becomes forwarded
    to the server to which the user is connected to. And then this server
    initiates the real nickname changing using regular NICK commands.
    This allows to run mixed networks with old servers not supporting the
    SVSNICK command, because SVSNICK commands for nicknames on such servers
    are silently ignored and don't cause a desynchronization of the network.
  - New configuration option "MaxListSize" to configure the maximum number
    of channels returned by a LIST command. The default is 100, as before.
  - Implement user mode "b", "block messages": when a user has set mode "b",
    all private messages and notices to this user are blocked if they don't
    originate from a registered user, an IRC Op, server or service. The
    originator gets an error numeric sent back in this case,
    ERR_NONONREG_MSG (486), which is used by UnrealIRCd, too. (Closes #144)
  - Implement channel mode "V" (invite disallow): If the new channel mode
    "V" is set, the INVITE command becomes invalid and all clients get the
    new ERR_NOINVITE_MSG (518) reply. (Closes #143)
  - Implement channel mode "Q" and user mode "q": Both modes protect users
    from channel kicks: only IRC operators and servers can kick users having
    mode "q" or in channels with mode "Q". (Closes #141)
  - Allow users to "cloak" their hostname only when the configuration
    variable "CloakHostModeX" (introduced in 19.2) is set. Otherwise, only
    IRC operators, other servers, and services are allowed to set the user
    mode "+x": this prevents regular users from changing their hostmask to
    the name of the IRC server itself, which confused quite a few people ;-)
    (Closes #133)
  - New configuration option "OperChanPAutoOp": If disabled, IRC operators
    don't become channel operators in persistent channels when joining.
    Enabled by default, which has been the behavior of ngIRCd up to this
    patch. (Closes #135)
  - Allow IRC operators to see secret (+s) channels in LIST command as long
    as the "MorePrivacy" configuration option isn't enabled in the
    configuration file. (Closes #136)
  - Implement new (optional) IRC+ "CHARCONV" command to set a client
    character set that the server translates all messages to/from UTF-8.
    This feature requires the "libiconv" library and must be enabled using
    the new "--with-iconv" option of the ./configure script. See
    doc/Protocol.txt for details. (Closes #109)
  - Implement user mode "B" ("Bot flag"): it is settable and unsettable by
    every (non-restricted) client. This is how Unreal and InspIRCd do
    behave, and so do we :-)
  - Implement channel mode "M": Only the server, identified users and IRC
    operators are able to talk in such a channel.
  - Block nicknames that are reserved for services and are defined using the
    configuration variable "ServiceMask" in "Server" blocks; And this
    variable now can handle more than one mask separated by commas.
  - Implemented XOP channel user modes: "Half Op" ("+h", prefix "%") can set
    the channel modes +imntvIbek and kick all +v and normal users; "Admin"
    ("+a", prefix "&") can set channel modes +imntvIbekoRsz and kick all +o,
    +h, +v and normal users; and "Owner" ("+q", prefix "~") can set channel
    modes +imntvIbekoRsz and kick all +a, +o, +h, +v and normal users.
  - Implement hashed cloaked hostnames for both the "CloakHost" and
    "CloakHostModeX" configuration options: now the admin can use the new
    '%x' placeholder to insert a hashed version of the clients hostname,
    and the new configuration option "CloakHostSalt" defines the salt for
    the hash function. When "CloakHostSalt" is not set (the default), a
    random salt will be generated after each server restart.

ngIRCd 19.2 (2012-06-19)

  ngIRCd 19.2~rc1 (2012-06-13)
  - New configuration option "CloakHostModeX" to configure the hostname
    that gets used for IRC clients which have user mode "+x" enabled.
    Up to now, the name of the IRC server itself has been used for this,
    which still is the default when "CloakHostModeX" isn't set.
  - Add instructions for setting up Atheme IRC services.
  - Implement support for IRC capability handling, the new "CAP" command,
    and capability "multi-prefix" which allows both the NAME and WHO command
    handlers to return more than one "class prefix" to the client.

ngIRCd 19.1 (2012-03-19)

  - Really include _all_ patches to build the Anope module into the
    distribution archive ... ooops!

ngIRCd 19 (2012-02-29)

  ngIRCd 19~rc1 (2012-02-12)
  - Update preliminary ngIRCd protocol module for Anope 1.9.6, which now
    is the only supported version.
  - New numeric RPL_WHOISHOST_MSG(378), which returns the DNS host name
    (if available) and the IP address of a client in the WHOIS reply.
    Only the user itself and local IRC operators get this numeric.
  - Implement channel exception list (mode 'e'). This allows a channel
    operator to define exception masks that allow users to join the
    channel even when a "ban" would match and prevent them from joining:
    the exception list (e) overrides the ban list (b).
  - Implement user mode 'C': If the target user of a PRIVMSG or NOTICE
    command has the user mode 'C' set, it is required that both sender
    and receiver are on the same channel. This prevents private flooding
    by completely unknown clients.
  - New RPL_WHOISREGNICK_MSG(307) numeric in WHOIS command replies: it
    indicates if a nickname is registered (if user mode 'R' set).
  - Limit channel invite, ban, and exception lists to 50 entries and fix
    duplicate check and error messages when adding already listed entries
    or deleting no (longer) existing ones.
  - Limit the number of list items in the reply of LIST (100), WHO (25),
    WHOIS (10), and WHOWAS (25) commands.
  - Limit the MODE command to handle a maximum number of 5 channel modes
    that require an argument (+Ibkl) per call and report this number
    in the ISUPPORT(005) numeric: "MODES=5".
  - LINKS command: support <mask> parameter to limit the reply.
  - Add 1 second penalty for every further target on PRIVMSG/NOTICE
    commands: this reduces the possibility of flooding channels with
    commands like "PRIVMSG/NOTICE #a,#n,#c,... :message" a little bit.
    Problem noticed by Cahata, thanks!
  - New configuration option "PAMIsOptional": when set, clients not
    sending a password are still allowed to connect: they won't become
    "identified" and keep the "~" character prepended to their supplied
    user name. See "man 5 ngircd.conf" for details.
  - Fixed handling of WHO commands. This fixes two bugs: "WHO <nick>"
    returned nothing at all if the user was "+i" (reported by Cahata,
    thanks) and "WHO <nick|nickmask>" returned channel names instead
    of "*" when the user was member of a (visible) channel.
  - LUSERS reply: only count channels that are visible to the requesting
    client, so the existence of secret channels is no longer revealed by
    using LUSERS. Reported by Cahata, thanks!
  - Unknown user and channel modes no longer stop the mode parser, but
    are simply ignored. Therefore modes after the unknown one are now
    handled. This is how ircd2.10/ircd2.11/ircd-seven behave, at least.
    Reported by Cahata, thanks!
  - Implement IRC commands "GLINE" and "KLINE" to ban users. G-Lines are
    synchronized between server on peering, K-Lines are local only.
    If you use "*!<user>@<host>" or "*!*@<host>" masks, these connections
    are blocked even before the user is fully logged in (before PASS,
    NICK, and USER commands have been processed) and before the child
    processes for authentication are forked, so resource usage is smaller.
  - Added doc/Modes.txt: document modes supported by ngIRCd.
  - Implement user mode "R": indicates that the nickname of this user
    is "registered". This mode isn't handled by ngIRCd itself, but must
    be set and unset by IRC services like Anope.
  - Implement channel mode "R": only registered users (having the user
    mode "R" set) are allowed to join this channel.
  - Test suite: bind to loopback (127.0.0.1) interface only.
  - Handle unknown user and channel modes: these modes are saved and
    forwarded to other servers, but ignored otherwise.
  - Handle channel user modes 'a', 'h', and 'q' from remote servers.
    These channel user modes aren't used for anything at the moment,
    but ngIRCd knows that these three modes are "channel user modes"
    and not "channel modes", that is that these modes take an "nickname"
    argument. Like unknown user and channel modes, these modes are saved
    and forwarded to other servers, but ignored otherwise.

ngIRCd 18 (2011-07-10)

  - Add preliminary ngIRCd protocol module for Anope 1.9 to contrib/Anope/.

  ngIRCd 18~rc2 (2011-06-29)
  - GnuTLS: use 1024 bits as minimum size of the DH prime. This enables
    ngIRCd to accept incoming connections from other servers and clients
    that "only" use at least 1024 bits again, like ngIRCd 17 did (and no
    longer requires 2048 bits for incoming connections).

  ngIRCd 18~rc1 (2011-06-27)
  - New configuration option "MorePrivacy" to "censor" some user information.
    When enabled, signon time and idle time is left out. Part and quit
    messages are made to look the same. WHOWAS requests are silently dropped.
    All of this is useful if one wish to conceal users that access the ngircd
    servers from TOR or I2P.
  - New configuration option "ScrubCTCP" to scrub incoming CTCP commands. If
    activated, the server silently drops incoming CTCP requests from both
    other servers and from users. The server that scrubs CTCP will not forward
    the CTCP requests to other servers in the network either, which can spell
    trouble if not every oper knows about the CTCP-scrubbing. Scrubbing CTCP
    commands also means that it is not possible to send files between users.
    There is one exception to the CTCP scrubbing performed: ACTION ("/me
    commands") requests are not scrubbed.
  - Restructure ngIRCd configuration file: introduce new [Limits], [Options],
    and [SSL] sections. The intention of this restructuring is to make the
    [Global] section much cleaner, so that it only contains variables that
    most installations must adjust to the local requirements. All the optional
    variables are moved to [Limits], for configurable limits and timers of
    ngIRCd, and [Options], for optional features. All SSL-related variables
    are moved to [SSL] and the "SSL"-prefix is stripped. The old variables in
    the [Global] section are deprecated now, but are still recognized.
    => Don't forget to check your configuration, use "ngircd --configtest"!
  - New documentation "how to contribute": doc/Contributing.txt.
  - Avoid needlessly scary 'buffer overflow' messages: When the write buffer
    space grows too large, ngIRCd has to disconnect the client to avoid
    wasting too much memory, which is logged with a scary 'write buffer
    overflow' message. Change this to a more descriptive wording.
  - New configuration option "RequireAuthPing": PING-PONG on login. When
    enabled, this configuration option lets ngIRCd send a PING with an numeric
    "token" to clients logging in; and it will not become registered in the
    network until the client responds with the correct PONG.
  - New configuration option "NoticeAuth": send NOTICE AUTH on connect. When
    active, ngircd will send "NOTICE AUTH" messages on client connect time
    like e.g. snircd (QuakeNet) does.
  - Add support for up to 3 targets in WHOIS queries, also allow up to one
    wildcard query from local hosts. Follows ircd 2.10 implementation rather
    than RFC 2812. At most 10 entries are returned per wildcard expansion.
  - ngircd.conf(5) manual page: describe types of configuration variables
    (booleans, text strings, integer numbers) and add type information to each
    variable description.
  - Terminate incoming connections on HTTP commands "GET" and "POST".
  - New configuration option "CloakHost": when set, this host name is used for
    every client instead of the real DNS host name (or IP address).
  - New configuration option "CloakUserToNick": when enabled, ngIRCd sets
    every clients' user name to their nickname and hides the user name
    supplied by the IRC client.
  - Make write buffers bigger, but flush early. Before this change, a client
    got disconnected if the buffer flushing at 4k failed, now regular clients
    can store up to 32k and servers up 64k even if flushing is not possible at
    the moment. This enhances reliability on slow links.
  - Allow "Port = 0" in [Server] blocks. Port number 0 marks remote servers
    that try to connect to this daemon, but where this daemon never tries to
    establish a connection on its own: only incoming connections are allowed.
  - Enable WHOIS command to return information about services.
  - Implement channel mode 'O': "IRC operators only". This channel mode is
    used on DALnet (bahamut), for example.
  - Remove support for ZeroConf/Bonjour/Rendezvous service registration
    including the "[No]ZeroConf" configuration option.
  - Deprecate NoXX-Options in ngircd.conf and move new variants into our new
    [Options] section: 'NoDNS=no' => 'DNS=yes', 'NoIdent=no' => 'Ident=yes',
    'NoPAM=no' => 'PAM=yes', and 'NoZeroConf=no' => 'ZeroConf=yes' (and
    vice-versa). The defaults are adjusted accordingly and the old variables
    in [Global] are still accepted, so there is no functional change.

ngIRCd 17.1 (2010-12-19)

  - Don't log critical (or worse) messages to stderr
  - Remove "error file" when compiled with debug code enabled
  - New numeric 329: get channel creation time on "MODE #chan" commands

ngIRCd 17 (2010-11-07)

  - doc: change path names in sample-ngircd.conf depending on sysconfdir

  ngIRCd 17~rc2 (2010-10-25)
  - Generate ngIRCd version number from GIT tag.
  - Make source code compatible with ansi2knr again. This allows to compile
    ngIRCd using a pre-ANSI K&R C compiler again.

  ngIRCd 17~rc1 (2010-10-11)
  - New configuration option "NoZeroConf" to disable service registration at
    runtime even if ngIRCd is compiled with support for ZeroConf (e.g. using
    Howl, Avahi or on Mac OS X).
  - New configuration option "SyslogFacility" to define the syslog "facility"
    (the "target"), to which ngIRCd should send its log messages.
    Possible values are system dependent, but most probably "auth", "daemon",
    "user" and "local1" through "local7" are possible values; see syslog(3).
    Default is "local5" for historical reasons.
  - Dump the "internal server state" (configured servers, established
    connections and known clients) to the console or syslog when receiving
    the SIGUSR2 signal and debug mode is enabled.
  - Enable the daemon to disable and enable "debug mode" on runtime using
    signal SIGUSR1, when debug code is compiled in, not only on startup
    using the command line parameters.
  - Implement user mode "x": host name cloaking (closes: #102).
  - Change MOTD file handling: ngIRCd now caches the contents of the MOTD
    file, so the daemon now requires a HUP signal or REHASH command to
    re-read the MOTD file when its content changed.
  - Allow IRC ops to change channel modes even without OperServerMode set.
  - Allow IRC operators to use MODE command on any channel (closes: #100).
  - New configuration option "NoPAM" to disable PAM.
  - Implement asynchronous user authentication using PAM, please see the
    file doc/PAM.txt for details.
  - Add some documentation for using BOPM with ngIRCd, see doc/Bopm.txt.
  - Implement user mode "c": receive connect/disconnect NOTICEs. Note that
    this new mode requires the user to be an IRC operator.
  - Show SSL status in WHOIS output, numeric 275.

ngIRCd 16 (2010-05-02)

  ngIRCd 16~rc2 (2010-04-25)
  - Enhance connection statistics counters: display total number of served
    connections on daemon shutdown and when a new client connects using
    the new numeric RPL_STATSCONN (250).

  ngIRCd 16~rc1 (2010-03-25)
  - Implement WEBIRC command used by some Web-IRC frontends. The password
    required to secure this command must be configured using the new
    "WebircPassword" variable in the ngircd.conf file.
  - Remove limit on max number of configured irc operators.
  - A new channel mode "secure connections only" (+z) has been implemented:
    Only clients using a SSL encrypted connection to the server are allowed
    to join such a channel.
    But please note three things: a) already joined clients are not checked
    when setting this mode, b) IRC operators are always allowed to join
    every channel, and c) remote clients using a server not supporting this
    mode are not checked either and therefore always allowed to join.

ngIRCd 15 (2009-11-07)

  ngIRCd 15~rc1 (2009-10-15)
  - Do not add default listening port (6667) if SSL ports were specified, so
    ngIRCd can be configured to only accept SSL-encrypted connections now.
  - Enable IRC operators to use the IRC command SQUIT (instead of the already
    implemented but non-standard DISCONNECT command).
  - New configuration option "AllowRemoteOper" (disabled by default) that
    enables remote IRC operators to use the IRC commands SQUIT and CONNECT
    on the local server.
  - Enforce upper limit on maximum number of handled commands. This implements
    a throttling scheme: an IRC client can send up to 3 commands or 256 bytes
    per second before a one second pause is enforced.

ngIRCd 14.1 (2009-05-05)

  - Security: fix remotely triggerable crash in SSL/TLS code.
  - Debian: build ngircd-full-dbg package.
  - Allow ping timeout quit messages to show the timeout value.

ngIRCd 14 (2009-04-20)

  ngIRCd 14~rc1 (2009-03-29)
  - Allow creation of persistent modeless channels.
  - The INFO command reports the compile time now (if available).
  - Support individual channel keys for pre-defined channels: introduce
    new configuration variable "KeyFile" in [Channel] sections in ngircd.conf,
    here a file can be configured for each pre-defined channel which contains
    individual channel keys for different users.
  - Remove limit on maximum number of predefined channels in ngircd.conf.

ngIRCd 13 (2008-12-25)

  ngIRCd 13~rc1 (2008-11-21):
  - New version number scheme :-)
  - Initial support for IRC services, using a RFC1459 style interface,
    tested with IRCServices (http://www.ircservices.za.net/) version 5.1.13.
    For this to work, ngIRCd now supports server-server links conforming
    to RFC 1459. New ngircd.conf(5) option: ServiceMask.
  - Support for SSL-encrypted server-server and client-server links using
    OpenSSL (configure: --with-openssl) or GNUTLS (configure: --with-gnutls).
    New ngircd.conf(5) options: SSLPorts, SSLKeyFile, SSLKeyFilePassword,
    SSLCertFile, SSLDHFile, and SSLConnect.
  - Server local channels have been implemented, prefix "&", that are only
    visible to users of the same server and are not visible in the network.
    In addition ngIRCd creates a "special" channel &SERVER on startup and logs
    all the messages to it that a user with mode +s receives.
  - New make target "osxpkg" to build a Mac OS X installer package.
  - New configuration option "NoIdent" to disable IDENT lookups even if the
    daemon is compiled with IDENT support.

ngIRCd 0.12.1 (2008-07-09)

  - Add option aliases -V (for --version) and -h (for --help).
  - Make Listen parameter a comma-separated list of addresses. This also
    obsoletes ListenIPv4 and ListenIPv6 options. If Listen is unset, it
    is treated as Listen="::,0.0.0.0".
    Note: ListenIPv4 and ListenIPv6 options are still recognized,
    but ngircd will print a warning if they are used in the config file.

ngIRCd 0.12.0 (2008-05-13)

  ngIRCd 0.12.0-pre2 (2008-04-29)
  - IPv6: Add config options to disable ipv4/ipv6 support.

  ngIRCd 0.12.0-pre1 (2008-04-20)
  - Add IPv6 support.
  - Install a LaunchDaemon script to start/stop ngIRCd on Mac OS X.
  - Implemented IRC commands INFO, SUMMON (dummy), and USERS (dummy) and
    enhanced test suite to check these commands. (Dana Dahlstrom)
  - IRC_WHO now supports search patterns and will test this against user
    nickname/server name/host name, etc. as required by RFC 2812, Section 3.6.1.
    (reported by Dana Dahlstrom)
  - Implement RFC 2812 handling of "0" argument to 'JOIN': must be treated
    as if the user had sent PART commands for all channels the user is a
    member of. (Dana Dahlstrom)
  - Allow NOTICEs to be sent to a channel. (Fabian Schlager)

ngIRCd 0.11.0 (2008-01-15)

  - Add support for /STAT u (server uptime) command.
  - New [Server] configuration Option "Bind" allows to specify
    the source IP address to use when connecting to remote server.
  - New configuration option "MaxNickLength" to specify the allowed maximum
    length of user nicknames. Note: must be unique in an IRC network!
  - Numeric 317: implemented "signon time" (displayed in WHOIS result).
  - Added new server configuration option "Passive" for "Server" blocks to
    disable automatic outgoing connections (similar to -p option to ngircd,
    but only for the specified server). (Tassilo Schweyer)
  - Added support for the WALLOPS command. Usage is restricted to IRC
    operators.

ngIRCd 0.10.2 (2007-06-08)

  - Predefined channel configuration now allows specification of channel key
    (mode k) and maximum user count (mode l): variables "Key" and "MaxUsers".
  - When using the epoll() IO interface, compile in the select() interface as
    well and fall back to it when epoll() isn't available on runtime.
  - Added support for IO APIs "poll()" and "/dev/poll".

ngIRCd 0.10.1 (2006-12-17)

  - Allow PASS syntax defined in RFC 1459 for server links, too.
  - New configuration option "PredefChannelsOnly": if set, clients can only
    join predefined channels.

ngIRCd 0.10.0 (2006-10-01)

  ngIRCd 0.10.0-pre1 (2006-08-02)
  - Enhanced DIE to accept a single parameter ("comment text") which is sent
    to all locally connected clients before the server goes down.
  - JOIN now supports more than one channel key at a time.
  - Implemented numeric "333": Time and user name who set a channel topic.
  - Channel topics are no longer limited to 127 characters: now the only limit
    is the maximum length of an IRC command, i. e. 512 bytes (in practice, this
    limits the topic to about 490 characters due to protocol overhead).
  - Reverse DNS lookup code now checks the result by doing an additional
    lookup to prevent spoofing.
  - Added new IO layer which (optionally) supports epoll() and kqueue() in
    addition to the select() interface.

ngIRCd 0.9.0 (2005-07-24)

  - Never run with root privileges but always switch the user ID.
  - Make "netsplit" messages RFC compliant.
  - Implemented the IRC function "WHOWAS".
  - New configuration option "OperServerMode" to enable a workaround needed
    when running an network with ircd2 servers and "OperCanUseMode" enabled
    to prevent the ircd2 daemon to drop mode changes of IRC operators.
    Patch by Florian Westphal, <westphal@foo.fh-furtwangen.de>.
  - Implemented support for "secret channels" (channel mode "s").
  - New configuration option "Mask" for [Operator] sections to limit OPER
    commands to users with a specific IRC mask. Patch from Florian Westphal.
  - New configuration variable "PidFile", section "[Global]": if defined,
    the server writes its process ID (PID) to this file. Default: off.
    Idea of Florian Westphal, <westphal@foo.fh-furtwangen.de>.
  - Added support for the Howl (http://www.porchdogsoft.com/products/howl/)
    Rendezvous API, in addition to the API of Apple (Mac OS X). The available
    API will be autodetected when you call "./configure --with-rendezvous".

ngIRCd 0.8.0 (2004-06-26)

  - Two new configuration options: "ChrootDir" and "MotdPhrase", thanks to
    Benjamin Pineau <ben@zouh.org>. Now you can force the daemon to change
    its root and working directory to something "safe". MotdPhrase is used
    to define an "MOTD string" instead of a whole file, useful if the
    "real" MOTD file would be outside the "jail".
  - INVITE- and BAN-lists become synchronized between IRC+ servers when
    establishing new connections, if the peer supports this as well.
  - The type of service (TOS) of all sockets is set to "interactive" now.
  - Added short command line option "-t" as alternative to "--configtest".
  - Added optional support for "IDENT" lookups on incoming connections. You
    have to enable this function with the ./configure switch "--with-ident".
    The default is not to do IDENT lookups.

ngIRCd 0.7.5 (2003-07-11)

  - New configuration variable "MaxConnectionsIP" to limit the number of
    simultaneous connections from a single IP that the server will accept.
    This configuration options lowers the risk of denial of service attacks
    (DoS), the default is 5 connections per client IP.
  - Added new configuration variable "Listen" to bind all listening
    sockets of the server to a single IP address.

ngIRCd 0.7.1 (2003-07-18)

  - Added support for GNU/Hurd.

ngIRCd 0.7.0 (2003-05-01)

  - New command CONNECT to enable and add server links. The syntax is not
    RFC-compatible: use "CONNECT <name> <port>" to enable and connect an
    configured server and "CONNECT <name> <port> <host> <mypwd> <peerpwd>"
    to add a new server (ngIRCd tries to connect new servers only once!).
  - Added DISCONNECT command ("DISCONNECT <name>") to disable servers.
  - New command TRACE (you can trace only servers at the moment).
  - New command HELP that lists all understood commands.
  - ngIRCd can register itself with Rendezvous: to enable support pass the
    new switch "--with-rendezvous" to configure.
  - Added support for TCP Wrappers library: pass "--with-tcp-wrappers" to
    configure to enable it.
  - Changed some configure options to use "--with"/"--without" as prefix
    instead of "--enable"/"--disable": "--without-syslog", "--without-zlib",
    "--with-tcp-wrappers", and "--with-rendezvous".
  - Enhanced manual pages ngircd(8) and ngircd.conf(5).
  - Documentation is now installed in $(datadir)/doc/ngircd.


Older news (sorry, only available in German language):

ngIRCd 0.6.0, 24.12.2002

  - beim Schliessen einer Verbindung zeigt der Server nun vor dem ERROR
    noch eine Statistik ueber die empfangene und gesendete Datenmenge an.
  - Connection-Strukturen werden nun "pool-weise" verwaltet; der Pool wird
    bei Bedarf bis zu einem konfigurierten Limit vergroessert.
  - Mit der neuen Konfigurationsvariable "MaxConnections" (Sekion "Global")
    kann die maximale Anzahl gleichzeitiger Verbindungen begrenzt werden.
    Der Default ist -1, "unlimitiert".
  - der Server erkennt nun, ob bereits eine eingehende Verbindung von einem
    Peer-Server besteht und versucht dann nicht mehr, selber eine eigene
    ausgehende Verbindung zu diesem auufzubauen. Dadurch kann nun auf beiden
    Servern in der Konfiguration ein Port fuer den Connect konfiguriert
    werden (beide Server versuchen sich dann gegenseitig zu connectieren).
  - Server identifizieren sich nun mit asynchronen Passwoertern, d.h. das
    Passwort, welches A an B schickt, kann ein anderes sein als das, welches
    B als Antwort an A sendet. In der Konfig.-Datei, Abschnitt "Server",
    wurde "Password" dazu durch "MyPassword" und "PeerPassword" ersetzt.
  - Der Server kann nun zur Laufzeit die Konfiguration neu einlesen: dies
    macht er nach dem Befehl REHASH oder wenn ein HUP-Signal empfangen wird.
  - Server-Server-Links koennen nun komprimiert werden, dazu wird die zlib
    (www.zlib.org) benoetigt. Unterstuetzt die Gegenseite die Komprimierung
    nicht, wird automatisch unkomprimiert kommuniziert. Das Verfahren ist
    kompatibel mit dem Original-ircd 2.10.3, d.h. beide Server koennen
    miteinander ueber komprimiert Links kommunizieren.
  - neue Konfigurations-Variable "MaxJoins": Hiermit kann die maximale Zahl
    der Channels, in denen ein User Mitglied sein kann, begrent werden.
  - neue Channel-Modes l (User-Limit) und k (Channel-Key) implementiert.

ngIRCd 0.5.0, 20.09.2002

  - AIX (3.2.5), HP-UX (10.20), IRIX (6.5), NetBSD (1.5.3/m68k) und Solaris
    (2.5.1, 2.6) gehoeren nun auch zu den unterstuetzten Platformen.
  - Unter A/UX (und evtl. weiteren Systemen) kompiliert der ngIRCd nun mit
    dem "nativen" (ggf. pre-ANSI) Compiler.
  - "persistente Channels" (Mode 'P') implementiert: diese koennen in der
    Konfigurationsdatei definiert werden (Sektion "Channel", vgl. Beispiel-
    Konfiguration "sample-ngircd.conf") und bleiben auch dann bestehen,
    wenn kein User mehr im Channel ist.
  - neue IRC-Befehle: KICK, INVITE, ADMIN, CHANINFO; LIST wurde erweitert.
    Mit dem neuen Befehl CHANINFO synchronisieren Server, die das IRC+-
    Protokoll unterstuetzen, Channel-Modes und Topics. Fuer den ADMIN-Befehl
    gibt es neue Konfigurationsoptionen (Sektion "Global"): "AdminInfo1",
    "AdminInfo2" und "AdminEMail".
  - Invite- und Ban-Lists implementiert.
  - neue Konfigurationsoption "OperCanUseMode" (Sektion "Global"):
    ist sie aktiv, koennen IRC-Operatoren immer Channel-Modes setzen.
  - "Test-Suite" begonnen: mit "make check" wird sie durchlaufen.

ngIRCd 0.4.2, 29.04.2002

  - IRC-Funktion LIST implementiert; bisher werden allerdings noch keine
    Regular Expressions (bis auf "*") unterstuetzt.

ngIRCd 0.4.0, 01.04.2002

  - WHO implementiert (bisher ohne komplette Unterstuetzung von Masks).
  - stderr wird nun in eine Datei umgelenkt (/ngircd-<PID>.err).
    Laeuft der Server nicht im Debug-Modus, so wird diese bei Programm-
    ende geloescht. Sollte der Server abstuerzen, finden sich hier evtl.
    zusaetzliche Informationen.
  - Server-Gruppen implementiert: es wird immer nur zu einem Server in
    einer Gruppe eine Verbindung aufgebaut, klappt es beim ersten Server
    nicht, so wird der naechste probiert.
  - Clients und Channels werden nicht mehr ueber ihren Namen, sondern
    einen Hash-Wert gesucht: sollte deutlich schneller sein.
  - neuer Kommandozeilen-Parameter "--configtest": die Konfiguration wird
    gelesen und die dann verwendeten Werte angezeigt.
  - Client-Mode "s" (Server Notices) implementiert.
  - mit dem neuen Kommandozeilen-Parameter "--config"/"-f" kann eine
    alternative Konfigurationsdatei angegeben werden.
  - nach dem Start kann der ngIRCd, wenn er mit root-Rechten laeuft,
    zu einer anderen User-ID und Group-ID wechseln.

ngIRCd 0.3.0, 02.03.2002

  - bekommt der Server ein HUP-Signal, so startet er neu -- genau so, wie
    er auf den IRC-Befehl RESTART reagiert.
  - neuer Kommandozeilen-Schalter "--passive" (-p): wird er angegeben, so
    verbindet sich der ngIRCd nicht mehr automatisch zu anderen Servern.
    Zum Debuggen manchmal ganz praktisch :-)
  - neue Befehle VERSION und KILL implementiert. NAMES korrigiert.
  - Anpassungen an A/UX: gehoert nun auch zu den unterstuetzten Platformen.
  - AWAY (und der User-Mode 'a') ist nun implementiert.
  - der ngIRCd unterstuetzt nun Channel-Topics (TOPIC-Befehl).
  - Channel- und Nicknames werden nun ordentlich validiert.

ngIRCd 0.2.0, 15.02.2002

  - Begonnen Channel-Modes und User-Channel-Modes zu implementieren: der
    Server versteht an User-Modes o und v, beachtet letzteres allerdings
    noch nirgends. Bekannte (aber nicht beachtete!) Channel-Modes sind
    bisher a, m, n, p, q, s und t. Diese Modes werden von Usern ange-
    nommen, von anderen Servern werden auch unbekannte Modes uebernommen.
  - Nach dem Connect eines Users werden LUSERS-Informationen angezeigt.

ngIRCd 0.1.0, 29.01.2002

  - Channels implementiert, bisher jedoch noch ohne Channel-Modes, d.h.
    es gibt keine Channel-Ops, kein Topic, kein "topic lock" etc. pp.
    Chatten in Channels ist aber natuerlich moeglich ;-)
    Dadurch zum Teil groessere Aenderungen an bisherigen Funktionen.
  - neue Befehle fuer Channles: JOIN, PART und NJOIN.
  - FAQ.txt in doc/ begonnen.

ngIRCd 0.0.3, 16.01.2002

  - Server-Links vollstaendig implementiert: der ngIRCd kann nun auch
    "Sub-Server" haben, also sowohl als Leaf-Node als auch Hub in einem
    IRC-Netzwerk arbeiten.
  - WHOIS wird nun immer an den "Original-Server" weitergeleitet.
  - Parser handhabt Leerzeichen zw. Parametern nun etwas "lockerer".
  - Kommandozeilen-Parser: Debug- und No-Daemon-Modus, Hilfe.
  - ngIRCd wandelt sich nun in einen Daemon (Hintergrundprozess) um.
  - neue Befehle: LUSERS, LINKS.

ngIRCd 0.0.2, 06.01.2002

  - neuer Aufbau der Konfigurationsdatei,
  - mehrere IRC-Operatoren koennen konfiguriert werden,
  - Server-Links teilweise implementiert. Bisher kann der ngIRCd jedoch
    nur "leafed server" sein, d.h. keine "Client-Server" haben.

ngIRCd 0.0.1, 31.12.2001

  - erste oeffentliche Version von ngIRCd als "public preview" :-)
