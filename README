               ngIRCd is free software and published under the
                   terms of the GNU General Public License.

I. Introduction
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

ngIRCd is a free, portable and lightweight Internet Relay Chat server for
small or private networks, developed under the GNU General Public License
(GPL; please see the file COPYING for details). It is simple to configure,
can cope with dynamic IP addresses, and supports IPv6 as well as SSL. It is
written from scratch and not based on the original IRCd.

The name ngIRCd means next generation IRC daemon, which is a little bit
exaggerated: lightweight Internet Relay Chat server most probably would be a
better name :-)

Please see the INSTALL document for installation and upgrade information!


II. Status
~~~~~~~~~~~

ngIRCd should be quite feature complete and stable to be used as daemon in
real world IRC networks.

It is not the goal of ngIRCd to implement all the nasty behaviors of the
original ircd, but to implement most of the useful commands and semantics
specified by the RFCs that are used by existing clients.
