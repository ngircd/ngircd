ngIRCd 27 (2024-04-26)

  - Update ChangeLog, NEWS, AUTHORS.md & doc/Platforms.txt for ngIRCd 27.
  - Clarify in the sample configuration file and the ngircd.conf(5) manual
    page that the "CAFile" option is unset by default.
  - Fix channel symbol returned in the RPL_NAMREPLY(353) numeric of NAMES
    commands for secret (mode +s) channels: this should be "@", not "=".
    Thanks Val Lorentz <progval+git@progval.net> for the patch!
    Closes #313.
  - Add an example filter file for "Fail2Ban": contrib/ngircd-fail2ban.conf.
  - Don't abort startup when setgid/setuid() fails with EINVAL: Both setgid(2)
    as well as setuid(2) can fail with EINVAL in addition to EPERM, their
    manual pages state "EINVAL: The user/group ID specified in uid/gid is not
    valid in this user namespace ". So not only treat EPERM as an "acceptable
    error" and continue with logging the error, but do the same for EINVAL.
    This was triggered by the Void Linux xbps-uunshare(1) tool used for
    building "XBPS source packages" and reported by luca in #ngircd. Thanks!
  - Test suite: Don't use "pgrep -u" when LOGNAME and USER are not set
    Thanks for reporting this on IRC, luca!

  ngIRCd 27~rc1 (2024-04-13)
  - Validate certificates on server links. Up to now, ngIRCd optionally used
    SSL/TLS encrypted server-server links but never checked and validated any
    certificates. Now ngIRCd validates SSL/TLS certificates on outgoing
    server-server links by default and drops(!) connections when the remote
    certificate is invalid (for example self-signed, expired, not matching the
    host name, ...). Therefore you have to make sure that all relevant
    *certificates are valid* (or to disable certificate validation on this
    connection using the new `SSLVerify = false` setting in the affected
    `[Server]` block, where the remote certificate is not valid and you can not
    fix this issue).
    The original patch for OpenSSL dates back to 2009 and was written by Florian
    Westphal and was extended for GnuTLS in 2014 by Christoph Biedl. But it took
    us another 10 years to bring it to life ... oh my! Many thanks to both
    Florian and Christoph!
    Closes #120.
  - Add support for the "sd_notify" protocol of systemd(8): Periodically
    "ping" the service manager (every 3 seconds) and set a status message
    showing current connection statistics which then is included in "systemctl
    status ngircd.service" output. In addition, this enables using the
    systemd(8) watchdog functionality ("WatchdogSec") for the "ngircd.service"
    unit and allows it to use the "notify" service type, which results in
    better status tracking by the service manager.
  - Try to set file descriptor limit to its maximum and show info on startup:
    The number of possible parallel connections is limited by the file
    descriptor limit of the process (among other things). Therefore try to
    upgrade the current "soft" limit to its "hard" maximum (but limited to
    100000 instead of "infinite"), and show an information or even warning when
    the limit is still less than the configured "MaxConnections" setting. Please
    note that ngIRCd and its linked libraries (like PAM) need file descriptors
    not only for incoming and outgoing IRC connections, but for reading files
    and inter-process communication, too! Therefore the actual connection limit
    is less(!) than the file descriptor limit!
  - Update and fix the logcheck(8) rules file.
  - METADATA: Fix unsetting the "cloakhost" hostname, which did not result in
    the original hostname being restored, but actually resulted in an empty
    string being used as the client hostname -- which is a protocol violation.
  - Update the "rpm" make target to use the rpmbuild(8) command.
  - Add a "Docker file" (contrib/Dockerfile) and corresponding documentation
    (doc/Container.md) to the project. The resulting container is based on the
    latest Debian "stable-slim" container and built using a "build container".
  - Remove outdated, unsupported and broken support for splint(1).
  - Don't show the default config file name on config errors: The configuration
    can be set in drop-in files in the include directory, too, so it is not
    clear in which file it is actually missing.
  - No longer use a default built-in value for the "IncludeDir" directive when
    a configuration file was explicitly specified on the command line using
    "--config"/"-f": This way no default include directory is scanned when a
    possibly non-default configuration file is used which (intentionally) did
    not specify an "IncludeDir" directive. So now you can use "-f /dev/null"
    for checking all built-in defaults, regardless of any local configuration
    files in the default drop-in directory (which would have been read in
    until this change).
  - No longer log channel keys ("passwords") for predefined channels.
  - The server "Name" in the "[Global]" section of the configuration file no
    longer needs to be set: When not set (or empty), ngIRCd now tries to
    deduce a valid IRC server name from the local host name ("node name"),
    possibly adding a ".host" extension when the host name does not contain a
    dot (".") which is required in an IRC server name ("ID").
    This new behavior, with all configuration parameters now being optional,
    allows running ngIRCd without any configuration file at all.
  - Silence some compiler warnings.
  - autogen.sh: Prefer automake 1.11 over other releases because this is the
    last release supporting "de-ANSI-fication" using the included ansi2knr tool.
    And because we _want_ to support old K&R platforms, we try hard to use this
    release of automake when available to generate our build system.
    Note: This is only relevant for you if you are building from Git sources.
  - Autodetect support for IPv6 by default: Until now, IPv6 support was disabled
    by default, which seems a bit outdated in 2024. Note: You still can pass
    "--enable-ipv6"/"--disable-ipv6" to the ./configure script to forcefully
    activate or deactivate IPv6 support.
  - Do IDENT requests even when DNS lookups are disabled: Up to now disabling
    DNS in the configuration disabled IDENT lookups as well (for no good
    reason). Now you can activate/deactivate DNS lookups and IDENT requests
    completely separately. Thanks for reporting this, Miniontoby!
    Closes #291.
  - Update config.guess (2023-08-22) and config.sub (2023-09-19) files.
  - Fix Channel Admins being able to to set Channel Owner status! "Sarah"
    reported this back in April 2021 and proposed a patch, thanks a lot!
  - Test suite: Update for OpenSSL 3.x, some command outputs changed, clean up
    shell scripts and make the getpid.sh script more robust.
  - Allow SSL client-only configurations without keys/certificates: You don't
    need to configure certificates/keys as long as you don't configure
    SSL-enabled listening ports. This can make sense when you want to only link
    your local daemon to an uplink server using SSL and only have clients on
    your local host or in your fully trusted network, where SSL is not required.
  - Remove the unmaintained contrib/MacOSX/ folder: this includes the Xcode
    project as well as the outdated macOS "Package Maker" configuration. The
    sample launchd(8) configuration properties list file was moved to
    "contrib/de.barton.ngircd.plist" and kept.
  - Fix showing the "Ident" option in "--configtest" output which was never
    shown because of a coding error. Whoops!
  - Change GnuTLS "slot handling" messages to debug level: Those messages are
    about an internal implementation detail, not relevant for an administrator
    of ngIRCd.
  - Enlarge buffer for log messages: For example, SSL/TLS certificate
    information can easily get longer than 256 characters. So enlarge the log
    buffer to 1 KB to avoid cutting off relevant information.
  - Respect "SSLConnect" option for incoming connections and do not accept
    incoming plain-text ("non SSL") server connections for servers configured
    with "SSLConnect" enabled. This change prevents an authenticated
    client-server being able to force the server-server to send its password
    on a plain-text connection when SSL/TLS was intended.
  - Always try to close a connection with errors immediately, but try hard
    to avoid too much recursion. Without this patch, an outgoing server
    connection could get stuck in an "endless" state trying to write out data
    over and over again.
  - Add "hopm.service" to "Wants" and "Before" dependencies in the sample
    systemd unit file (Hopm is the successor of Bopm).
  - Update Debian package configuration using current "dh_make", package
    dependencies and build rules. And no longer build 3 different versions,
    only build "ngircd" which now includes support for IDENT, PAM (disabled in
    the ngircd.conf installed by the package), SSL (OpenSSL), ZLib and IPv6.
  - Return ERR_NOTEXTTOSEND on empty PRIVMSG content, which matches the
    behavior of other servers.
  - Add a new option "Autojoin" to [Channel] blocks: When it is set, ngIRCd
    automatically joins all local users to this channel on connect. Note: The
    users must have permissions to access the channel, otherwise joining them
    will fail!
    Thanks Ivan Agarkov <i_agarkov@wargaming.net> for the initial patch!
  - Hide invisible (+i) users on "WHOIS <pattern>": Let's behave like most(?)
    other IRC daemons (at least ircd2.11) and hide all +i users when WHOIS is
    used with a pattern. Otherwise privacy of this users is not guaranteed and
    the +i mode a bit useless ...
    Reported by Cahata on #ngircd, thanks!
  - Update the final "closing connection" message: Add some more information
    like nick name, user name, host name and bring it in line with some other
    implementations (at least ircd2.11 and Hybrid).
  - Fix RPL_INVITING message: All numeric replies must originate from an IRC
    server, never from a client. Thanks "tommyrot" for reporting this!
    Closes #307.
  - Enhance some log messages, for example for errors when accepting new
    connections.
  - Make the debug log level ("--debug"/-"d" command line option) always
    available, not only when ./configure'd with "--enable-debug": the latter
    now only enables additional checks (like the tests done using assert(2))
    and is signalled by adding "+DEBUG" to the version "feature string". This
    change enables everyone to get even more detailed logging when required.
  - Always report an error when a parameter is missing in a channel "MODE +k"
    or "MODE +l" command, and better validate their parameters: return the new
    numeric ERR_INVALIDMODEPARAM_MSG(696) on errors.
    Thanks Val Lorentz for reporting this!
    Closes #290.
  - Allow IRC Operators to use the WHO command on any channel.
  - Add configuration for "ngIRCd CI" GitHub Action, no longer use Travis-CI.
  - Send the NAMES list and channel topic to users "forcefully" joined to a
    channel using NJOIN, like they joined on their own using JOIN, and
    streamline the order of NAMES list and channel topic messages.
    Closes #288.
  - Fix (invalid) error messages when setting modes on local channels which
    are defined in the configuration file.
  - Fix handling of G-Lines/K-Lines with cloaked host names.
  - Streamline logging of debug messages.
  - Added a new command line option "-y"/"--syslog", with which logging to
    syslog can be activated/deactivated separately from running on the console
    (using "--nodaemon") or in the background.
    Thanks Katherine Peeters for the patch and pull request!
    Closes #294.
  - Fix a possible race condition while introducing new clients in the network.
  - Update, enhance and extend our documentation in README.md, INSTALL.md,
    doc/HowToRelease.txt and the manual pages ngircd(8) and ngircd.conf(5), add
    a new doc/QuickStart.md document, and convert some more documentation files
    to Markdown (AUTHORS.md, contrib/README.md, doc/FAQ.md, doc/SSL.md).

ngIRCd 26.1 (2021-01-02)

  - Fix a "format string" compiler warning (detected on OpenBSD).
  - No longer set "AI_ADDRCONFIG" when resolving host names, even when it
    exists: with this option set, on an IPv6-only host, we prevent 127.0.0.1
    to get translated properly, even when the loopback interface has this
    address configured! And as the test suite uses 127.0.0.1, it was broken
    on IPv6-only hosts.
    The drawback is that the resolver possibly returns more addresses now,
    even of an unsupported/not connected address family; but this shouldn't
    do much harm in practice, as ngIRCd iterates over all returned addresses
    while trying to establish an outgoing connection.
    Closes #281.
  - Revert "Show allowed channel types in ISUPPORT(005) numeric only", which
    was introduced in 26~rc1: This lead to some IRC clients assuming "oh, no
    channel prefix characters at all, so no channels at all, so no PRIVMSG can
    go to any channel" when "AllowedChannelTypes" was set to the empty string
    ("") -- which is not the case when there are pre-defined channel set up or
    other servers still having channels!
    So "allowed channel types" != "supported channel types", and we always have
    to list all supported ones in the ISUPPORT(005) numeric!
    Closes #285.
  - Test suite: Wait 2 seconds after reloading the daemon, which is required
    because on reload, all listening ports are closed, configuration updated,
    and then opened again. This lead to subsequent tests running while the
    daemon isn't listening on any ports, and that's why some tests could fail.
    Closes #280.
  - platformtest.sh: Try to mangle CLang name more intelligently.
  - Documentation: Fixed URLs of Atheme IRC services, updated all mentions
    from CVS to Git, and updated Platforms.txt -- Oh, and it is 2021 now! ;-)

ngIRCd 26 (2020-06-20)

  ngIRCd 26~rc2 (2020-06-11)
  - Add AppStream metadata file (contrib/de.barton.ngircd.metainfo.xml).
  - Don't send invalid CHANINFO commands when a channel has mode +k set but no
    key is known to the server. This can happen with a misconfigured predefined
    channel, for example, and looked like this: "CHANINFO #test +Pk  0 :" --
    note the unset key represented by the two spaces. Fix this by sending a
    "*" in this case and update the CHANINFO documentation, too.
  - ngircd.spec: Fix names of README.md and INSTALL.md, add ".md" extension.
  - Update description texts in the README.md file, the RPM and Debian package
    files and the manual page: bring them in line with the updated homepage.
  - Server-Server protocol: Fix use-after-free when unregistering a directly
    connected server sending a SQUIT for itself.
  - Server-Server protocol: Detect bogus SERVER commands lacking a prefix.
    Thanks Hilko Bengen (hillu) for finding & reporting this as well for the
    patch & pull request (even if fixed differently).
    Closes #275.
  - Fix the PING-PONG logic: In ngIRCd 26~rc1 this was completely broken (while
    trying to fix timeouts during server handshakes in bigger networks): the
    daemon never disconnected any stale peers but kept sending out PINGs over
    and over again ...
  - Test suite: Add missing files needed to test SSL support to "EXTRA_DIST",
    so that they are included in distribution archives: in rc1, "make check"
    fails when using sources from an archive and enabling SSL support.
    Thanks to Hilko Bengen <bengen@hilluzination.de> for the patch!

  ngIRCd 26~rc1 (2020-05-10)
  - Tweak & update doc/HowToRelease.txt, .mailmap and AUTHORS files.
  - Allow up to 512 characters per line in MOTD and help text files (but keep
    in mind that lines can't get that long, because they have to be prefixed
    before being sent to the client). But this allows for more fancy MOTDs :-)
    Closes #271.
  - Show the actually allowed channel types in the ISUPPORT(005) numeric which
    are configured by the "AllowedChannelTypes" configuration variable.
    Closes #273.
  - Handle commands in the read buffer before reading more data and don't wait
    for the network in this case: If there are more bytes in the read buffer
    already than a single valid IRC command can get long (513 bytes), wait for
    this/those command(s) to be handled first and don't try to read even more
    data from the network (which most probably would overflow the read buffer
    of this connection soon).
  - Update Travis-CI configuration, "sudo" is deprecated.
  - Log G-/K-Line changes only when not initiated by a server: this prevents
    the log from becoming spammed during "net bursts".
  - Update test suite to include SSL tests, including checking for reloading
    certificates during runtime.
  - Makefile.am: Replace "make" with "${MAKE}". This fixes warnings like this:
    "warning: jobserver unavailable: using -j1. Add `+' to parent make rule."
    Thanks to Sam James (sam_c) <sam@cmpct.info>!
    Closes #270.
  - Add support for GnuTLS certificate reload, which is quite handy when using
    Let's Encrypt, for example. Until now this was only supported when linked
    with OpenSSL. Thanks a lot, Hilko Bengen <bengen@hilluzination.de>!
  - Remove deprecated legacy configuration options and related functions that
    have been marked for removal for quite some time:
    - PredefChannelsOnly (v22)
    - NoticeAuth (v24)
    - NoXXX (v19)
    - Old '[GLOBAL]' section handling (v19)
    Thanks to Michi <michi+ngircd@dataswamp.org> for the patch!
  - Fix recursion bug on write errors: Depending on the stack size, too many
    clients on the same channel quitting at the same time would trigger a crash
    due to too many recursive calls to Conn_Close(). Thanks to Michi
    <michi+ngircd@dataswamp.org> for the patch!
  - Fix builds using GCC option -fno-common, which is the default starting with
    GCC 10. Thanks to Michi <michi+ngircd@dataswamp.org> for the patch!
    Closes #266.
  - Convert INSTALL and README files to Markdown.
  - Allow setting arbitrary channel modes in the configuration file by handling
    them like in MODE commands, and allow multiple "Modes =" lines per [Channel]
    section. Thanks to Michi <michi+ngircd@dataswamp.org>!
    Closes #55.
  - Add "FNC" (forced nick changes) to ISUPPORT(005) numeric. Most probably
    this doesn't make any difference to any client, but it seems correct.
    See <http://www.irc.org/tech_docs/005.html> for details.
  - Reuse old SSL key if loading a new one failed.
  - Remove outdated OpenBSD/NetBSD systrace.policy.
  - Enhance handling of command line errors, and return with exit code 0 ("no
    error") when "--help" or "--version" is used (which resulted in exit code 1,
    "error" before). Exit with code 2 ("command line error") for all other
    invalid command line options, and show the error message itself on stderr
    (instead of stdout and exit code 1, "generic error", as before).
    This new behavior is more in line with the GNU "coding standards",
    see <https://www.gnu.org/prep/standards/html_node/_002d_002dhelp.html>.
  - Fix and update Xcode project: Reference correct contrib/Makefile.am file,
    correctly sort contrib/nglog.sh and add "ORGANIZATIONNAME" setting.
  - contrib/ngindent.sh: Add more GNU indent options for better results, and
    add the ".sh" suffix to bring this script in line with the others in the
    contrib/ folder.
  - Add ./contrib/nglog.sh: This script parses the log output of ngircd(8),
    and colorizes the messages according to their log level. Example usage:
    ngircd -f $PWD/doc/sample-ngircd.conf -np | ./contrib/nglog.sh
  - Log received signals with their names using strsignal(3), when available.
  - Make test suite compatible with Haiku OS.
  - Fix host mask cloaking bug, don't cloak multiple times: Previously, each
    server would cloak every user's host mask. The problem is that if a network
    has more than one server, then a user's host mask would get cloaked twice.
    This patch ensures that a server only cloaks the host mask if it has not yet
    been cloaked (the period indicates it's still an IP address). Thanks to
    JRMU <jrmu@lecturify.com> for the patch!
    Closes #228.
  - Enlarge buffers of info texts to 128 bytes. This includes:
    - "Real name" of a client (4th filed of the USER command).
    - Server info text ("Info" configuration option).
    - Admin info texts and email address ("AdminInfo1", "AdminInfo2" and
      "AdminEmail" configuration options).
    - Network name ("Network" configuration option).
    The limit was 64 bytes before ...
    Closes #258.
  - Streamline handling of invalid and unset server name: Don't exit during
    runtime (REHASH command, HUP signal), because the server name can't be
    changed in this case anyway and the new invalid name will be ignored.
  - Fix and extend documentation: Fix some typos, fix syntax of LINKS and LIST
    commands, whitespace and spelling fixes, update dependencies and add some
    more information about IRCv3 support.
    Thanks to Thanks Windree, Étienne Mollier <etienne.mollier@mailoo.org> and
    Christoph Biedl <debian.axhn@manchmal.in-ulm.de>.
    Closes #264.
  - Slightly reorder startup steps, and enhance logging:
    - Show name of configuration file at the beginning of start up.
    - Add a message when ngIRCd is ready, including its host name.
    - Show name of configuration file on REHASH (SIGHUP), too.
    - Change level of "done message" to NOTICE, like "starting" & "ready".
    - Initialize IO functions before channels, connections, clients, ...
  - configure.ng: OpenSSL can depends on lz or latomic so use pkg-config to
    find those dependencies and fallback to existing mechanism.
    Closes #256.
  - ngircd.conf.5: Fix wording as suggested by lintian.

ngIRCd 25 (2019-01-23)

  - Fix documentation of MotdPhrase length, which actually is 126 characters:
    update sample configuration file as well as the man page. Thanks to
    shankari <shankari@eecs.berkeley.edu>.
    Closes #254.
  - Implement new configuration option "MaxPenaltyTime", which configures the
    maximum penalty time increase in seconds, per penalty event. Set to -1 for
    no limit (the default), 0 to disable penalties altogether. ngIRCd doesn't
    use penalty increases higher than 2 seconds during normal operation, so
    values higher than 1 rarely make sense.
    Disabling (or reducing) penalties can greatly speed up "make check" runs
    for example, see below, but are mostly a debugging feature and normally
    not meant to be used on production systems!
    Some example timings running "make check" from my macOS workstation:
     - MaxPenaltyTime not set: 4:41,79s
     - "MaxPenaltyTime = 1":   3:14,71s
     - "MaxPenaltyTime = 0":     25,46s
    Closes #249 and #251.
  - Fix compilation without deprecated OpenSSL APIs. Thanks to Rosen Penev
    <rosenp@gmail.com> for the patch!
    Closes #252.
  - Update Xcode project for latest Xcode version (10.0)
  - Fix some compiler warnings of Apple Xcode/Clang
  - Allow a 5th parameter in WEBIRC. Thanks to "ItsOnlyBinary".
    Closes #247.
  - Update some more documentation files and source code comments.
  - Platforms.txt: Add and update systems.

  ngIRCd 25~rc1 (2018-08-11)
  - Update config.guess (2018-03-08) and config.sub (2018-03-08) files.
  - Correctly retry to establish an outgoing connections when forking of the
    resolver sub-process failed (for example because of lack of free memory).
    Until now, such a connection was never retried once this error was hit.
    Thanks to Robert Obermeier for reporting this bug!
    Closes #243.
  - Fix a "use after free" bug which can be triggered on a newly established
    connection when the daemon handles an ERROR command received from the peer
    during client login. Thanks a lot to Joseph Bisch <joseph.bisch@gmail.com>
    for discovering and reporting this issue!
  - Only send TOPIC updates to a channel when the topic actually changed:
    This prevents the channel from becoming flooded by unnecessary TOPIC update
    messages, that can happen when IRC services try to enforce a certain topic
    but which is already set (at least on the local server), for example.
    Therefore still forward it to all servers, but don't inform local clients
    (still update setter and timestamp information, though).
  - Update Xcode project for latest Xcode version (9.2). This includes adding
    missing and deleting obsolete file references.
  - Handle user mode "C" ("Only users that share a channel are allowed to send
    messages") like user mode "b" ("block private messages and notices"): allow
    messages from servers, services, and IRC Operators, too. Change proposed by
    "wowaname" back in 2015 in #ngircd, thanks!
  - Fix some compiler warnings.
  - Add contrib/ngircd.logcheck: Some sample logcheck(8) rules.
  - Allow IRC Ops and remote servers to KILL service clients: such clients
    behave like regular users, therefore IRC operators and servers should be
    able to KILL them: for example to resolve nick collisions.
    Closes #242.
  - Don't forward KILLs to other servers if they've been blocked locally:
    This prevents clients from killing IRC services, for example.
    Closes #238 and #239.
  - Fix a cross-compiler issue related to the Get_Error() function.
    Closes #240 and #241.
  - Update ./doc/Services.txt, enhance configuration examples.

ngIRCd 24 (2017-01-20)

  - Make sure that ./contrib/platformtest.sh aborts when ./autogen.sh fails.
  - Update config.guess (2016-10-02) and config.sub (2016-11-04) files.
  - Build Debian packages with OpenSSL instead of GnuTLS: OpenSSL allows
    to reload used certificates on runtime for example (which is very
    useful when using Let's Encrypt), and therefore is preferred. And
    explicitly specify the "source format".
  - Fix handling of connection pool allocation and enlargement: up to now,
    the daemon only enlarged its connection pool when accepting new incoming
    client or server connections, not when establishing new outgoing server
    links, which could lead to problems when hitting the configured limit,
    see "MaxConnections". Thanks to Lukas Braun (k00mi) for reporting this!
    Closes #231.

  ngIRCd 24~rc1 (2017-01-07)
  - Enhance systemd service file, and install it in Debian package.
  - Update configuration of Debian package.
  - Log privilege violations and failed OPER request with log level "error"
    and send it to the "&SERVER" channel, too.
  - Immediately shut down connection when receiving an "ERROR" command,
    don't wait for the peer to close the connection. This allows the daemon
    to forward the received "ERROR" message in the network, instead of the
    very generic "client closed connection" message.
  - Fix sending of entry duration (no negative values!) when synchronizing
    "x-lines" (G-LINES).
  - List expiration (G-LINES): use same log level as when setting, and log
    this event to the &SERVER channel, too.
  - Explicitly forbid remote servers to modify "x-lines" (G-LINES) when the
    "AllowRemoteOper" configuration option isn't set, even when the command
    seems to originate from the remote server itself: this prevents GLINE's
    to become set during server handshake in this case (what wouldn't be
    possible during regular runtime when a remote IRC Op sends the command)
    and what can't be undone by IRC Ops later on (because of the missing
    "AllowRemoteOper" option) ...
  - Make scripts and init-files in ./contrib executable.
  - Fix building ngIRCd with OpenSSL 1.1. Thanks to Christoph Biedl
    <ngircd.anoy@manchmal.in-ulm.de> for the patch!
  - Fix code indentation warnings of gcc 6.2.
  - Update config.guess (2016-04-02) and config.sub (2016-03-30) files.
  - Fix warnings of the "shellcheck" linter in autogen.sh, contrib/ngindent
    and contrib/platformtest.sh.
  - Update Xcode project for latest Xcode version (8.0), and fix "duplicate
    symbols" error messages when building (linking) the binary.
  - Add "Documentation" variables to systemd configuration files.
  - Make sure that SYSCONFDIR is always set, which can be handy when
    using source code linters when ./configure hasn't been run already.
  - Add the new "PAMServiceName" configuration option to specify the name
    used as PAM service name. This setting allows to run multiple ngIRCd
    instances with different PAM configurations for each instance.
    Thanks to Christian Aistleitner <christian@quelltextlich.at> for the
    patch, closes #226.
  - Add an ".editorconfig" file to the project.
  - Travis-CI: use "container-based infrastructure".
  - Limit the number of message targets, and suppress duplicates: This
    prevents an user from flooding the server using commands like this:
    "PRIVMSG nick1,nick1,nick1,...".
    Duplicate targets are suppressed silently (channels and clients).
    In addition, the maximum number of targets per PRIVMSG, NOTICE, ...
    command are limited to MAX_HNDL_TARGETS (25). If there are more, the
    daemon sends the new 407 (ERR_TOOMANYTARGETS_MSG) numeric, containing
    the first target that hasn't been handled any more. Closes #187.
  - Test suite: Add new test for server-server logins.
  - contrib/ngindent: Fix shebang line.
  - Make contrib/platformtest.sh script more portable, and only show
    "runs=Y" when the test suite really has been passed successfully.
  - Code cleanup in the NJOIN handler and the function killing clients as
    well as the function sending messages to a "mask" (cleaner code, more
    fault tolerant, better code comments).
  - Update and enhance documentation: README file, doc/Platforms.txt,
    doc/Modes.txt, doc/Commands.txt, doc/PAM.txt.
  - Fix NJOIN not propagating "half ops" status: ngIRCd tested for the wrong
    prefix of "half ops" when processing NJOIN commands and therefore never
    classified a remote user as "half op".
    Thanks to wowaname for pointing this out on #ngircd!

ngIRCd 23 (2015-11-16)

  - Explicitly cast time_t to long when printing it out: this prevents
    wrong sized data types on platforms where time_t doesn't equal a
    long any more, for example on OpenBSD (which would result in garbled
    output on those platforms).
  - contrib/Debian/changelog: Fix email address.
  - Documentation: Spelling fixes; update doc/Platforms.txt.

  ngIRCd 23~rc1 (2015-09-06)
  - Add ".clang_complete" file, which is used by the "linter-clang" package
    of the Atom editor, for example.
  - Make server-to-server protocol more robust: ngIRCd now catches more
    errors on the server-to-server (S2S) protocol that could crash the
    daemon before. This hasn't been a real problem because the IRC S2S
    protocol is "trusted" by design, but the behavior is much better now.
    Thanks to wowaname on #ngircd for pointing this out!
  - Make platformtest.sh, autogen.sh, and ngircd.init more portable.
  - Enables "reproducible builds" for ngIRCd: Use the optional BIRTHTIME
    constant while building ngIRCd, which contains a time stamp for the
    "Birth Date" information, in seconds since the epoch.
    See <https://wiki.debian.org/ReproducibleBuilds>.
  - Update "contrib/ngircd.service" file for systemd.
  - INSTALL: Add deprecation notice for "PredefChannelsOnly" variable.
  - Use "NOTICE *" before registration instead of "NOTICE AUTH". "AUTH" is
    a valid nickname so sending notices to it is probably not a good idea.
    Use "*" as the target instead as done with numerics when the nick is not
    available. This mimics the behavior in Charybdis, IRCD-Hybrid, InspIRCd
    2.2, Plexus 4, etc. Closes #217.
    The "NoticeAuth" configuration variable (ngircd.conf) has been renamed
    to "NoticeBeforeRegistration" accordingly, but the old name is still
    supported for compatibility reasons.
  - Implement new channel mode "N" (regular users can't change their nick
    name while on this channel). Closes #214.
  - README, AUTHORS: Update mailing list and issue tracker URLs.
  - Remove doc/GIT.txt (it is outdated), update doc/Contributing.txt:
    ngIRCd uses GitHub, and Git itself is quite common today. So don't
    include an own Git "mini HowTo" any longer.
  - Specify session context for OpenSSL clients. This enables some OpenSSL
    clients, including Pidgin and stunnel 5.06, to reuse a session.
    Patch by Tom Ryder <tom@sanctum.geek.nz>, thanks! Closes #182.
  - Keep track of who placed bans, invites, and excepts.
    Idea and implementation by LucentW, Thanks! Closes #203.
  - Make setgroups(3) function optional: For example, Interix is missing
    this function, which prevented ngIRCd to build on this platform. When
    setgroups(3) isn't available, a warning message is issued on startup.
  - Implement numeric RPL_LISTSTART(321). lightIRC and other clients
    expecting RPL_LISTSTART should now behave correctly.
    Idea and implementation by LucentW, Thanks! Closes #207.
  - Update ngircd.conf.5: "CloakUserToNick" hides user _and_ real name.
    This closes #208.
  - Fix case insensitive pattern matching: Up to now, only the input
    string became lowercased and was then compared to the pattern -- which
    failed when the pattern itself wasn't all lowercase!
  - Streamline the effect of "MorePrivacy" option: Update documentation
    in ngircd.conf(5); don't hide channels for IRC Ops on LIST and don't
    hide IP addresses/hostnames on WHOIS when "MorePrivacy" is in effect.
    This closes #198.
  - IRC operators now can kick anyone when "OperCanMode" is set.
    Idea and implementation by LucentW, Thanks! Closes #202.
  - Implement user mode "I": Hide channels on WHOIS: this mode prevents
    ngIRCd from showing channels on WHOIS (IRC Operators can always see
    the channel list).
    Idea and implementation by LucentW, Thanks! Closes #197.
  - INVITE command: Implement ERR_USERNOTONSERV(504) numeric and make sure
    that the target user is on the same server when inviting other users
    to local ("&") channels.
    Idea by Cahata, thanks! Closes #183.
  - INVITE command: Enforce 1 second penalty time, which prevents flooding
    of the target client.
    This closes #186. Reported by Cahata, thanks!
  - MODE command: Always report channel creation time. Up to now when
    receiving a MODE command, ngIRCd only reported the channel creation
    time to clients that were members of the channel. This patch reports
    the channel creation time to all clients, regardless if they are joined
    to that channel or not. At least ircd-seven behaves like this.
    This closes #188. Reported by Cahata, thanks!
  - Update Xcode project for latest Xcode version (6.3).

ngIRCd 22.1 (2015-04-06)

  - Update doc/Platforms.txt and doc/FAQ.txt.
  - Fix spelling of RPL_WHOISBOT message text.
  - Don't send nick name as default PART reason: No other IRC daemon seems
    to do this (today?). Closes #185.
    Reported by Cahata in #ngircd, thanks!
  - Fix "WHO #<chan>" showing invisible users and hiding all visible, the
    logic was reversed! This bug has been introduced by commit c74115f2,
    "Simplify mode checking on channels and users within a channel", ngIRCd
    releases 21, 21.1, and 22 are affected :-( Problem reported by Cahata
    in #ngircd, Thanks!
  - Fix typo in src/testsuite/README
  - Auth PING: Fix our information text for manual sending of "PONG". Up to
    now, ngIRCd doesn't send a valid IRC command at all, oops!
  - Auth PING: Fix internal time stamp conversion and don't send a prefix in
    our PING command. The prefix confuses WeeChat, at least, which doesn't
    send an appropriate PONG in the case ...
    Debugging and patch by "wowaname" on #ngircd, thanks!
  - Fix syntax of ERR_LISTFULL_MSG(478) numeric. Pointed out by "wowaname"
    in #ngircd, thanks!
  - Enhance debug messages while sending CHANINFO commands.
  - Reset "last try" timer when enabling a passive server. This results in
    a new connection attempt as soon as possible.
  - Change log message for "Can't resolve address" and for IP address
    forgeries.
  - doc/HowToRelease.txt: Add note about the bug tracker.
  - Update "CipherList" to not enable SSLv3 by default. Idea, initial patch,
    and testing by Christoph Biedl <ngircd.anoy@manchmal.in-ulm.de>.
  - Change ngIRCd test suite not to use DNS lookups: Different operating
    systems do behave quite differently when doing DNS lookups, for example
    "127.0.0.1" sometimes resolves to "localhost" and sometimes to
    "localhost.localdomain" (for example OpenBSD). And other OS resolve
    "localhost" to the real host name (for example Cygwin). So not using
    DNS at all makes the test site much more portable.

ngIRCd 22 (2014-10-11)

  - Match all list patterns case-insensitive: this affects the invite-,
    ban-, and except lists, as well as G-Lines an K-Lines.
    Problem pointed out by "wowaname" on #ngircd, thanks!

  ngIRCd 22~rc1 (2014-09-29)
  - Sync "except lists" between servers: Up to now, ban, invite, and G-Line
    lists have been synced between servers while linking -- but obviously
    nobody noticed that except list have been missing ever since. Until now.
    Thanks to "j4jackj", who reported this issue in #ngircd.
  - Allow longer user names (up to 63 characters) for authentication.
  - Correctly check that a server has a valid hostname and port, thanks to
    David Binderman <dcb314@hotmail.com> who reported this bug.
  - Fix the function which generates complete "IRC masks" from user input,
    don't destroy the source buffer and use all provided parts (nick, user,
    host name). This fixes GLINEs/KLINEs from not working in some situations.
  - Increase MAX_SERVERS from 16 to 64: There are installations out there
    that would like to configure more than 16 links per server, so increase
    this limit. Best would be to get rid of MAX_SERVERS altogether and make
    if fully dynamic, but start with this quick and dirty hack ...
  - Debian: Don't adjust path names that are correct by default and correctly
    set and use "docdir".
  - Update config.guess and config.sub to recent versions.
  - Test suite/platformtest.sh: Detect when tests have been skipped.
  - doc/Bopm.txt: Update "connregex" and "kline" for current ngIRCd.
  - Allow "DefaultUserModes" to set all possible modes, including modes only
    settable by IRC Operators.
  - Spoofed prefixes: Really kill connection on non-server links.
  - Implement user mode "F": "relaxed flood protection". Clients with mode
    "F" set are allowed to rapidly send data to the daemon. This mode is only
    settable by IRC Operators and can cause problems in the network -- so be
    careful and only set it on "trusted" clients!
    User mode "F" is used by Bahamut for this purpose, for example.
  - Handle "throttling" in a single function: ngIRCd implements "command
    throttling" and "bps throttling" (bytes per second). The states are
    detected in different functions, Conn_Handler() and Read_Request(), but
    handle the actual "throttling" in a common function: this enables us to
    guarantee consistent behavior and to disable throttling for special
    connections in only one place
  - Use server password when PAM is compiled in but disabled.
  - Streamline punctuation of log messages.
  - Return ISUPPORT(005) numerics on "VERSION". This is how ircd-seven,
    Charybdis, Hybrid, and InspIRCd behave, for example.
  - configure: Only link "contrib/Debian" if it exists, which isn't the case
    on "VPATH builds", for example.
  - Show the account name in WHOIS. This uses the same numeric as Charybdis
    and ircu families: WHOISLOGGEDIN(330).
  - Pattern matching: Remove "range matching" in our pattern matching code
    using the "[...]" syntax, because [ and ] are valid characters in nick
    names and one has to quote them currently using the "\" character, which
    is quite unexpected for users.
  - platformtest.sh: New option "-x", don't regenerate build system and
    allow using separate source and build trees.
  - Test suite: explicitly enable glibc memory checking.
  - Make "MODE -k" handling more robust and compatible, send "fake '*' key"
    in all replies.
  - Update configure.ng: ngIRCd requires GNU autoconf 2.61 for generating its
    build system, so update the build system accordingly and implement all
    changes that autoupdate(1) suggests: Update AC_PREREQ and AC_INIT, use
    AC_LINK_IFELSE, AC_RUN_IFELSE, and AC_COMPILE_IFELSE, and remove
    AC_TYPE_SIGNAL (we don't use RETSIGTYPE).
  - portabtest: Actually test the functions snprintf(), strlcpy(), strlcat(),
    and vsnprintf() for correctness, not only existence (which was quite
    useless, because if they weren't available, the program could not have
    been linked at all ...).
  - Implement new configuration option "Network": it is used to set the
    (completely optional) "network name", to which this instance of the
    daemon belongs. When set, this name is used in the ISUPPORT(005) numeric
    which is sent to all clients connecting to the server after logging in.
  - Update doc/Platforms.txt.
  - Various code cleanups, remove unused code, streamline error handling.
    Remove all imp.h and exp.h header files, support non-standard vsnprintf()
    return codes, and fix some K&R C portability issues. Streamline
    DEBUG_ARRAY, DEBUG_BUFFER, DEBUG_IO, DEBUG_ZIP definitions.
  - Increase penalty time to 10 seconds when handling OPER commands with an
    invalid password.

ngIRCd 21.1 (2014-03-25)

  - Don't ignore but use the server password when PAM is compiled in but
    disabled. Thanks to Roy Sindre Norangshol <roy.sindre@norangshol.no>!
  - doc/Platforms.txt: Update from master branch.
  - Really kill connections that send "spoofed prefixes" on non-server links.
    This fixes commit 6cbe1308 which only killed the connection when the
    spoofed prefix itself belonged to a non-server client.
  - CHARCONV command: Fix handling conversion errors, don't overwrite already
    converted text!
  - doc/Services.txt: Update information for Anope 2.x.
  - Correctly use cloaked IRC masks on "INVITE nickname": The cloaked IRC mask
    of a user is his visible mask, so the daemon has to use it for generating
    the "one time" entries for the invite list of the given channel, and not
    the "real" mask which will never match while the target client is "+x", and
    even worse, will disclose the real mask on "MODE #channel +I" commands :-/
    Bug reported by Cahata on #ngircd, thanks!
  - configure: Only link "contrib/Debian" if it exists. This isn't the case on
    "VPATH builds", for example.
  - Use $(MKDIR_P) instead of $(mkinstalldirs) in Makefile's and test for
    "mkdir -p" using AC_PROG_MKDIR_P in "configure".
  - Fix configure script and "make check" for TCP Wrappers (problems spotted on
    OpenBSD): add missing #include's and static variables, and add libwrap at
    the end of the configure run because if libwrap becomes added earlier,
    other tests may fail.
  - configure: add support for the LDFLAGS_END and LIBS_END variables to add
    linker flags and libraries at the end of the configure run (CFLAGS_END has
    been implemented already).
  - platformtest.sh and Makefile.am: Don't use "test -e", it isn't portable.
  - Update Copyright notices for 2014 :-)
  - Fix permanent {G|K}LINES (with a timeout of 0 seconds).
  - WEBIRC: Don't set the hostname received by the WEBIRC command when DNS
    lookups are disabled, but use the IP address instead.
    Reported by Toni Spets <toni.spets@iki.fi>, thanks!
  - Check for working getaddrinfo() function: At least AIX 4.3.3 and 5.1 have a
    broken implementation of getaddrinfo() which doesn't handle "0" as numeric
    service correctly. This patch adds a configure check for this case and
    changes all calling functions to only use getaddrinfo() if it "works".
    See <http://www.stacken.kth.se/lists/heimdal-discuss/2004-05/msg00059.html>
  - Only use the unsetenv() function when it is available (AIX 4.3 doesn't
    support it, for example).
  - Make sure that the source code is still compatible with the "ansi2knr" tool
    and builds using non-ANSI K&R C compilers. Tested with Apple C on A/UX.
  - Fix building ngIRCd without support for ZLIB compression.  Reported by
    "der_baer" on #ngircd, thanks!

ngIRCd 21 (2013-10-30)

  - ./contrib/Debian/ngircd.init: Make sure no stale PID file is left over
    when (re-)starting ngIRCd.
  - Change ./contrib/platformtest.sh and update ./doc/Platforms.txt to
    allow user names up to 8 characters.
  - Call arc4random_stir() in forked subprocesses, when available. This
    is required by FreeBSD <10 and current NetBSD at least to correctly
    initialize the "arc4" random number generator on these platforms.
  - Update our own Debian package configuration and fix the default path
    of the "HelpFile" of the "full" package variants.

  ngIRCd 21~rc2 (2013-10-20)
  - Report the correct configuration file name on configuration errors,
    support longer configuration lines, and warn when lines are truncated.
  - Use arc4random() function to generate "random" numbers, when available.
  - platformtest.sh: Detect clang compiler, and clean up GIT source tree
    before building (when possible).
  - Update (date of) manual pages.
  - Update "Upgrade Information" in INSTALL file, add more systems to
    doc/Platforms.txt, and fix spelling in NEWS and ChangeLog files =:)
  - Fix remaining compiler warnings on OpenBSD.

  ngIRCd 21~rc1 (2013-10-05)
  - Actually KILL clients on GLINE/KLINE. (Closes bug #156)
  - Adjust log messages for invalid and spoofed prefixes, which cleans up
    logging of commands related to already KILL'ed clients. And don't
    forward KILL commands for (already) unknown clients any more to prevent
    unnecessary duplicates.
  - Add support to show all user links using the "STATS L" (uppercase)
    command (restricted to IRC Operators).
  - Fixed blocking of server reconnects in some error configurations.
  - Don't ignore SSL-related errors during startup any more: abort startup
    when SSL is requested by the configuration but can't be initialized and
    don't continue only listening on plain text communication ports.
    (Closes bug #163)
  - Implement configurable SSL cipher list selection for GnuTLS and OpenSSL
    using the new configuration option "CipherList". In addition, this
    changes the defaults to more secure values: "HIGH:!aNULL:@STRENGTH" for
    OpenSSL, and "SECURE128" for GnuTLS.
  - Fix "TRACE": Correctly return ERR_NEEDMOREPARAMS(461) (which basically
    is "syntax error") when there are too many parameters.
  - Clean up lots of permission and parameter checks in functions handling
    IRC commands; and more consistently add penalty times on errors.
  - Fix error numeric of WHOIS when no nick name has been provided:
    as per RFC it should be ERR_NONICKNAMEGIVEN(431).
  - Only log "IDENT ... no result" messages when an IDENT looked took place
    and didn't return any data, not when IDENT has been disabled.
  - Show connection flag "s" (SSL) in RPL_TRACE{LINK|SERVER} messages: now
    you can check if a server-to-server link is SSL-encrypted or not using
    the IRC "TRACE" command.
  - Correctly discard supplementary groups on server startup.
  - Save client IP address text for "WebIRC" users and correctly display
    it on WHOIS, for example. (Closes bug #159)
  - Implement the new configuration option "DefaultUserModes" which lists
    user modes that become automatically set on new local clients right
    after login. Please note that only modes can be set that the client
    could set on itself, so you can't set "a" (away) or "o" (IRC Op),
    for example! User modes "i" (invisible) or "x" (cloaked) etc. are
    "interesting", though. (Closes bug #160)
  - Add support for the new METADATA "account" property, which allows
    services to automatically identify users after netsplits and across
    service restarts.
  - Enforce "penalty times" on error conditions more consistently and in
    more places. Now most error codes sent back from the IRC server to the
    client should result in a 2 second "penalty".
  - Implement a new configuration option "AllowedChannelTypes" that lists
    all allowed channel types (channel prefixes) for newly created channels
    on the local server. By default, all supported channel types are allowed.
    If set to the empty string, local clients can't create new channels at
    all, which equals the old "PredefChannelsOnly = yes" setting.
    This change deprecates the "PredefChannelsOnly" variable, too, but it is
    still supported and translated to the appropriate "AllowedChannelTypes"
    setting. When the old "PredefChannelsOnly" variable is processed, a
    warning message is logged. (Closes bug #152)
  - Add support for "client certificate fingerprinting". When a client
    passes an SSL certificate to the server, the "fingerprint" will be
    forwarded in the network which enables IRC services to identify the
    user using this certificate and not using passwords.
  - IRC Operator names, as defined in ngircd.conf, are logged now when
    handling successful OPER commands.
  - Some error conditions while handling IRC commands, like "permission
    denied" or "need more parameters", result in more penalty times.
  - The numeric replies of some commands became split too early which
    resulted in more numeric reply lines than necessary.
  - Implement a new configuration option "IncludeDir" in the "[Options]"
    section that can be used to specify a directory which can contain
    further configuration files and configuration file snippets matching
    the pattern "*.conf". These files are read in after the main server
    configuration file ("ngircd.conf" by default) has been read in and
    parsed.  The default is "$SYSCONFDIR/ngircd.conf.d", so that it is
    possible to adjust the configuration only by placing additional files
    into this directory. (Closes bug #157)
  - Fix use-after-free in the Lists_CheckReason() function, which is used
    to check if a client is a member of a particular ban/invite/... list.
  - Xcode: fix detection of host OS, vendor, and CPU type, and update
    project settings for Xcode 5.
  - OS X PackageMaker: use relative path names in project files and package
    with correct file permissions (requires root privileges on "make").
  - Add Travis-CI configuration file (".travis.yml") to project.
  - Look for possible cloaked Masks in Lists. Users with +x user mode can
    be banned with their cloaked hostname now.
  - Don't read SSL client data before DNS resolver is finished which could
    have resulted in discarding the resolved client hostname and IDENT
    reply afterwards, because in some situations (timing dependent) the
    NICK and USER commands could have already been read in from the client,
    stored in the buffer, and been processed.
    Thanks to Julian Brost for reporting the issue and testing, and to
    Federico G. Schwindt <fgsch@lodoss.net> for helping to debug it!
  - Increase password length limit to 64 characters. (Closes bug #154)
  - doc/Services.txt: Update Anope status and URL.
  - Clean up Xcode project file, remove outdated files, add missing ones.
  - Update Doxygen configuration file.
  - configure: search for iconv_open as well as libiconv_open, because
    on some installations iconv_open() is actually libiconv_open().
    iconv_open() is the glibc version while libiconv_open() is the
    libiconv version, now both variants are supported. (Closes bug #151)
  - ngIRCd now accepts user names including "@" characters, saves the
    unmodified name for authentication but stores only the part in front
    of the "@" character as "IRC user name". And the latter is how
    ircd2.11, Bahamut, and irc-seven behave as well. (Closes bug #155)
  - Lots of IRC "information functions" like ADMIN, INFO, ... now accept
    server masks and names of connected users (in addition to server names)
    for specifying the target server of the command. (Closes bug #153)
  - Implement a new configuration option "IdleTimeout" in the "[Limits]"
    section of the configuration file which can be used to set a timeout
    in seconds after which the whole daemon will shutdown when no more
    connections are left active after handling at least one client.
    The default is 0, "never".
    This can be useful for testing or when ngIRCd is started using "socket
    activation" with systemd(8), for example.
  - Implement support for systemd(8) "socket activation".
  - contrib/README: add description for more files.
  - Enable WHOIS to display information about IRC Services using the new
    numeric 310(RPL_WHOISSERVICE) This numeric is used for this purpose by
    InspIRCd, for example -- but as usual, other numerics are in use, too,
    like 613 in UltimateIRCd ...
    Please note that neither the Operator (+o) not the "bot status" (+B)
    of an IRC service is displayed in the output.
  - Exit message: use singular & plural :-)
  - autogen.sh: Check for autoconf/automake wrapper scripts
  - Add missing punctuation marks in log messages, adjust some severity
    levels, and make SSL-related messages more readable.
  - AUTHORS file: Update list of contributors.
  - Update systemd(8) example configuration files in ./contrib/ directory:
    the "ngircd.service" file now uses the "forking" service type which
    enhances the log messages shown by "systemctl status ngircd.service",
    and the new "ngircd.socket" file configures a systemd socket that
    configures a socket for ngIRCd and launches the daemon on demand.
  - Enhance help system and the HELP command: now a "help text file" can be
    set using the new configuration option "HelpFile" ("global" section),
    which is read in and parsed on server startup and configuration reload,
    and then is used to output individual help texts to specific topics.
    Please see the file ./doc/Commands.txt for details.

ngIRCd 20.3 (2013-08-23)

  - Security: Fix a denial of service bug (server crash) which could happen
    when the configuration option "NoticeAuth" is enabled (which is NOT the
    default) and ngIRCd failed to send the "notice auth" messages to new
    clients connecting to the server (CVE-2013-5580).

ngIRCd 20.2 (2013-02-15)

  - Security: Fix a denial of service bug in the function handling KICK
    commands that could be used by arbitrary users to crash the daemon
    (CVE-2013-1747).
  - WHO command: Use the currently "displayed hostname" (which can be cloaked!)
    for hostname matching, not the real one. In other words: don't display all
    the cloaked users on a specific real hostname!
  - configure: The header file "netinet/in_systm.h" already is optional in
    ngIRCd, so don't require it in the configure script. Now ngIRCd can be
    built on Minix 3 again :-)
  - Return better "Connection not registered as server link" errors: Now ngIRCd
    returns a more specific error message for numeric ERR_NOTREGISTERED(451)
    when a regular user tries to use a command that isn't allowed for users but
    for servers.
  - Don't report ERR_NEEDMOREPARAMS(461) when a MDOE command with more modes
    than nicknames is handled, as well as for channel limit and key changes
    without specifying the limit or key parameters.
    This is how a lot (all?) other IRC servers behave, including ircd2.11,
    InspIRCd, and ircd-seven. And because of clients (tested with Textual and
    mIRC) sending bogus MODE commands like "MODE -ooo nick", end-users got the
    expected result as well as correct but misleading error messages ...
  - Correctly detect when SSL subsystem must be initialized and take
    outgoing connections (server links!) into account, too.
  - autogen.sh: Enforce serial test harness on GNU automake >=1.13. The
    new parallel test harness which is enabled by default starting with
    automake 1.13 isn't compatible with our test suite.
    And don't use "egrep -o", instead use "sed", because it isn't portable
    and not available on OpenBSD, for example.

ngIRCd 20.1 (2013-01-02)

  - Allow ERROR command on server and service links only, ignore them and
    add a penalty time on all other link types.
  - Enforced mode setting by IRC Operators: Only check the channel user
    modes of the initiator if he is joined to the channel and not an IRC
    operator enforcing modes (which requires the configuration option
    "OperCanUseMode" to be enabled), because trying to check channel user
    modes of a non-member results in an assertion when running with debug
    code or could crash the daemon otherwise. This closes bug #147, thanks
    to James Kirwill <james.kirwill@bk.ru> for tracking this down!
  - Fix build system to cope with spaces in path names.
  - Code cleanups, mostly to fix build warnings on Cygwin.

ngIRCd 20 (2012-12-17)

  - Allow user names ("INDENT") up to 20 characters when ngIRCd has not
    been configured for "strict RFC mode". This is useful if you are using
    external (PAM) authentication mechanisms that require longer user names.
    Patch suggested by Brett Smith <brett@w3.org>, see
    <http://arthur.barton.de/pipermail/ngircd-ml/2012-October/000579.html>.

  ngIRCd 20~rc2 (2012-12-02)
  - Rework cloaked hostname handling and implement the "METADATA cloakhost"
    subcommand: Now ngIRCd uses two fields internally, one to store the
    "real" hostname and one to save the "cloaked" hostname. This allows
    "foreign servers" (aka "IRC services") to alter the real and cloaked
    hostnames of clients without problems, even when the user itself issues
    additional "MODE +x" and "MODE -x" commands.
  - RPL_UMODEIS: send correct target name, even on server links.
  - Update platformtest.sh to follow autoconf changes and only generate
    the "configure" script when it is missing.
  - Fix the test suite to correctly execute test scripts even when stdout
    is redirected.
  - Fix some compiler warnings on NetBSD and OpenBSD.

  ngIRCd 20~rc1 (2012-11-11)
  - Update doc/Services.txt: describe the upcoming version of Anope 1.9.8,
    then including a protocol module for ngIRCd. And remove our own patches
    in ./contrib/Anope because they aren't supported any more ...
  - Implement new "METADATA" command which can be used by remote servers
    and IRC services to update client metadata like the client info text
    ("real name"), user name, and hostname, and use this command to
    configure an cloaked hostname (user mode "+x") on remote servers:
    This prevents "double cloaking" of hostnames and even cloaked
    hostnames are in sync on all servers supporting "METADATA" now.
  - Fix error message when trying to join non-predefined channels and the
    "PredefChannelsOnly" configuration option is set.
  - Implement new IRC "SVSNICK" command to allow remote servers (and IRC
    services) to change nicknames of already registered users. The SVSNICK
    command itself doesn't change the nickname, but it becomes forwarded
    to the server to which the user is connected to. And then this server
    initiates the real nickname changing using regular NICK commands.
    This allows to run mixed networks with old servers not supporting the
    SVSNICK command, because SVSNICK commands for nicknames on such servers
    are silently ignored and don't cause a desynchronization of the network.
  - Make server reconnect time a little bit more random, so that two
    servers trying to connect to each other asynchronously don't try this
    in exactly the same time periods and kick each other off ...
  - Don't accept connections for servers already being linked: there was a
    time frame that could result in one connection overwriting the other,
    e. g. the incoming connection overwriting the status of the outgoing
    one. And this could lead to all kind of weirdness (even crashes!) later
    on: now such incoming connections are dropped.
  - New configuration option "MaxListSize" to configure the maximum number
    of channels returned by a LIST command. The default is 100, as before.
  - Implement user mode "b", "block messages": when a user has set mode "b",
    all private messages and notices to this user are blocked if they don't
    originate from a registered user, an IRC Op, server or service. The
    originator gets an error numeric sent back in this case,
    ERR_NONONREG_MSG (486), which is used by UnrealIRCd, too. (Closes #144)
  - WHOIS: Not only show RPL_WHOISHOST_MSG to local IRC operators, but show
    it to all IRC operators in the network. And don't show it to anybody if
    the "more privacy" configuration option is enabled. (Closes #134)
  - Test suite: make expect scripts more verbose displaying dots for each
    reply of the server that it is waiting for.
  - WHOIS: Implement numeric RPL_WHOISMODES_MSG (379) and show user modes in
    the reply of the WHOIS command for the user himself or, if MorePrivacy
    isn't set, for request initiated by an IRC operator. (Closes #129)
  - Implement channel mode "V" (invite disallow): If the new channel mode
    "V" is set, the INVITE command becomes invalid and all clients get the
    new ERR_NOINVITE_MSG (518) reply. (Closes #143)
  - KICK-protect IRC services.
  - Implement channel mode "Q" and user mode "q": Both modes protect users
    from channel kicks: only IRC operators and servers can kick users having
    mode "q" or in channels with mode "Q". (Closes #141)
  - Debian: require "telnet" or "telnet-ssl" for building and enable
    CHARCONV in ngircd-full[-dbg] variants.
  - Send RPL_REHASHING (382) numeric if a REHASH command was accepted.
  - Fix spelling and variable names in some log messages.
  - Allow users to "cloak" their hostname only when the configuration
    variable "CloakHostModeX" (introduced in 19.2) is set. Otherwise, only
    IRC operators, other servers, and services are allowed to set the user
    mode "+x": this prevents regular users from changing their hostmask to
    the name of the IRC server itself, which confused quite a few people ;-)
    (Closes #133)
  - New configuration option "OperChanPAutoOp": If disabled, IRC operators
    don't become channel operators in persistent channels when joining.
    Enabled by default, which has been the behavior of ngIRCd up to this
    patch. (Closes #135)
  - Allow IRC operators to see secret (+s) channels in LIST command as long
    as the "MorePrivacy" configuration option isn't enabled in the
    configuration file. (Closes #136)
  - Enhance build system: Support new (>=1.12) and old (<=1.11) GNU automake
    versions, update checks for required and optional features, enable
    colored test output of automake (if available), rename configure.in to
    more modern configure.ac, include .mailmap and all build-system files in
    distribution archives and no longer require a GIT tree to detect the
    correct version string.
  - Update documentation: add doc/Contributing.txt and include version
    numbers in doc/Modes.txt.
  - Free all listen ports on initialization: now listen ports can be
    reconfigured on runtime using a configuration reload.
  - Initialize SSL when needed only, and disable SSL on errors.
  - Implement new (optional) IRC+ "CHARCONV" command to set a client
    character set that the server translates all messages to/from UTF-8.
    This feature requires the "libiconv" library and must be enabled using
    the new "--with-iconv" option of the ./configure script. See
    doc/Protocol.txt for details. (Closes #109)
  - Allow limited punctuation in usernames, for better PAM integration.
  - Correctly re-initialize signal handlers on RESTART commands.
  - Show a warning on startup if the configuration file is not a full path:
    ngIRCd is a long-running process and changes its working directory to
    "/" to not block mounted filesystems and the like when running as daemon
    ("not in the foreground"); therefore the path to the configuration file
    must be relative to "/" (or the chroot() directory), which basically is
    "not relative", to ensure that "kill -HUP" and the "REHASH" command work
    as expected later on. (Closes #127)
  - Make the "&SERVER" channel definable in a [Channel] configuration block,
    which enables server operators to overwrite the built-in topic and
    channel modes. (Closes #131)
  - Don't limit list size of "WHO #channel" commands, because it makes no
    sense to not return all the users in that channel, so I removed the
    check. But if there are more than MAX_RPL_WHO(25) replies, the client
    requesting the list will be "penalized" one second more, then 2 in
    total. (Closes #125)
  - Make ngIRCd buildable using the kqueue() IO interface on FreeBSD 4.x.
  - Fix the "NoticeAuth" configuration option when using SSL connections and
    enhance the message to show the hostname and IDENT reply of the client.
  - Introduce numeric RPL_HOSTHIDDEN_MSG (396): This numeric is sent to the
    client each time it changes its displayed hostname using "MODE +/-x",
    and if "CloakHost" is set right after the MOTD has been sent.
  - Fix USERHOST not displaying the correctly cloaked hostname.
  - Implement user mode "B" ("Bot flag"): it is settable and unsettable by
    every (non-restricted) client. This is how Unreal and InspIRCd do
    behave, and so do we :-)
  - Dynamically allocate memory for connection passwords: This a) saves
    memory for clients not using passwords at all and b) allows for
    "arbitrarily" long passwords.
  - Implement channel mode "M": Only the server, identified users and IRC
    operators are able to talk in such a channel.
  - Block nicknames that are reserved for services and are defined using the
    configuration variable "ServiceMask" in "Server" blocks; And this
    variable now can handle more than one mask separated by commas.
  - Now "make uninstall" removes the installed "ngircd.conf" file, if it is
    still equal to our "sample-ngircd.conf" file and therefore hasn't been
    modified by the user. If it has been modified, it isn't removed and a
    notice is displayed to the user. And "make install" now displays a
    message when no ngircd.conf file exists and the "sample-ngircd.conf"
    file will be installed as a starting point.
  - Add contrib/ngircd.service, a systemd service file for ngircd.
  - Implemented XOP channel user modes: "Half Op" ("+h", prefix "%") can set
    the channel modes +imntvIbek and kick all +v and normal users; "Admin"
    ("+a", prefix "&") can set channel modes +imntvIbekoRsz and kick all +o,
    +h, +v and normal users; and "Owner" ("+q", prefix "~") can set channel
    modes +imntvIbekoRsz and kick all +a, +o, +h, +v and normal users.
  - Implement hashed cloaked hostnames for both the "CloakHost" and
    "CloakHostModeX" configuration options: now the admin can use the new
    '%x' placeholder to insert a hashed version of the clients hostname,
    and the new configuration option "CloakHostSalt" defines the salt for
    the hash function. When "CloakHostSalt" is not set (the default), a
    random salt will be generated after each server restart. (Closes #133)

ngIRCd 19.2 (2012-06-19)

  - doc/Capabilities.txt: document "multi-prefix" capability

  ngIRCd 19.2~rc1 (2012-06-13)
  - New configuration option "CloakHostModeX" to configure the hostname
    that gets used for IRC clients which have user mode "+x" enabled.
    Up to now, the name of the IRC server itself has been used for this,
    which still is the default when "CloakHostModeX" isn't set.
  - Correctly handle asynchronously re-established server links: a race
    condition could let the daemon loose track of an already re-established
    incoming server link while preparing its own outgoing connection.
    Peers that both try to connect each other could have been affected.
  - Log a debug message when SIGUSR2 is handled in debug mode.
  - Only allow alphanumeric characters in user-supplied user names of
    USER command and IDENT replies.
  - Change wording of "TLS initialized" message to make it more consistent.
  - Don't leak file descriptors on error path when creating "PID files".
  - Add missing mode "r" to CHANMODES in 005 "ISUPPORT" numeric.
  - Update doc/Modes.txt and doc/Platforms.txt documents.
  - contrib/platformtest.sh: correctly detect Open64 C compiler and handle
    "CC=xxx MAKE=yyy ./platformtest.sh" calling convention.
  - Add instructions for setting up Atheme IRC services.
  - Implement support for IRC capability handling, the new "CAP" command,
    and capability "multi-prefix" which allows both the NAME and WHO command
    handlers to return more than one "class prefix" to the client.
  - Update Xcode project files: reference missing documentation files.
  - Fix: Don't ignore "permission denied" errors when enabling chroot.
  - FAQ: enhance description of chroot setup.

ngIRCd 19.1 (2012-03-19)

  - Fix gcc warning (v4.6.3), initialize "list" variable to NULL.
  - Fix typos: "recieved" -> "received", "Please not" -> "Please note",
    and fix lintian(1) warning ""hyphen-used-as-minus-sign", too.
  - Really include _all_ patches to build the Anope module into the
    distribution archive ... ooops!
  - getpid.sh: Fix test case error for Debian using sbuild(1).
  - Don't log "ngIRCd hello message" two times when starting up.

ngIRCd 19 (2012-02-29)

  - Update build system: bump config.guess and config.sub files used by
    GNU autoconf/automake to recent versions.
  - Fix configuration file parser: don't accept "[SSL]" blocks in the
    configuration file when no SSL support is built in ngIRCd.
  - Fix building ngIRCd with old gcc versions (e. g. 2.7.2).
  - Correctly re-open syslog logging after reading of configuration
    file: Syslog logging has been initialized before reading the
    configuration, so ngIRCd always used the default facility and ignored
    the "SyslogFacility" configuration option ...
    Thanks to Patrik Schindler for reporting this issue!

  ngIRCd 19~rc1 (2012-02-12)
  - Enhance command limits for server links: the limit now is dependent
    on the number of users connected in the network and higher while
    servers are joining the network to make the login of servers faster.
  - Log more information about server synchronization.
  - Update preliminary ngIRCd protocol module for Anope 1.9.6, which now
    is the only supported version.
  - New numeric RPL_WHOISHOST_MSG(378), which returns the DNS host name
    (if available) and the IP address of a client in the WHOIS reply.
    Only the user itself and local IRC operators get this numeric.
  - Implement channel exception list (mode 'e'). This allows a channel
    operator to define exception masks that allow users to join the
    channel even when a "ban" would match and prevent them from joining:
    the exception list (e) overrides the ban list (b).
  - PRIVMSG and NOTICE: Handle nick!user@host masks case-insensitive.
  - Implement user mode 'C': If the target user of a PRIVMSG or NOTICE
    command has the user mode 'C' set, it is required that both sender
    and receiver are on the same channel. This prevents private flooding
    by completely unknown clients.
  - New RPL_WHOISREGNICK_MSG(307) numeric in WHOIS command replies: it
    indicates if a nickname is registered (if user mode 'R' set).
  - Limit channel invite, ban, and exception lists to 50 entries and fix
    duplicate check and error messages when adding already listed entries
    or deleting no (longer) existing ones.
  - Fix both ERR_SUMMONDISABLED(445) and ERR_USERSDISABLED(446) replies.
  - MODE command: correctly return ERR_UNKNOWNMODE(472) numeric for
    unknown channel modes, instead of ERR_UMODEUNKNOWNFLAG(501).
  - ISUPPORT(005) numeric: add "O", "R", and "z" modes to "CHANMODES",
    add "EXCEPTS=e" and "INVEX=I", add "MAXLIST=beI:50".
  - Limit the number of list items in the reply of LIST (100), WHO (25),
    WHOIS (10), and WHOWAS (25) commands.
  - LIST command: compare pattern case insensitive.
  - Limit the MODE command to handle a maximum number of 5 channel modes
    that require an argument (+Ibkl) per call and report this number
    in the ISUPPORT(005) numeric: "MODES=5".
  - Fix handling of channel mode sequence with/without arguments.
    For example, don't generate wrong error messages when handling
    "MODE #chan +IIIIItn *!aa@b *!bb@c *!cc@d *!dd@e *!ee@f".
  - When sending data on a connection, only try to get the type of
    the client if there still is one assigned. This could trigger an
    assertion and end the daemon in some error paths.
  - Don't try to close already closed/invalid sockets to forked child
    processes. This could potentially crash the daemon in some cases
    with IDENT lookups enabled.
  - WHOIS command: make sure that the reply ends with RPL_ENDOFWHOIS,
    don't answer queries for IRC servers, make sure mask matching is
    case-insensitive, and that RPL_ENDOFWHOIS numeric is sent with the
    unmodified mask (like it has been received from the client).
  - LINKS command: support <mask> parameter to limit the reply.
  - Add 1 second penalty for every further target on PRIVMSG/NOTICE
    commands: this reduces the possibility of flooding channels with
    commands like "PRIVMSG/NOTICE #a,#n,#c,... :message" a little bit.
    Problem noticed by Cahata, thanks!
  - Display correct error message when "Server{UID|GID}" variable in the
    configuration file is invalid (not a number and no existing user).
  - Update Copyright notices for 2012 :-)
  - JOIN command: don't stop handling of channel lists when a single
    channel cannot be joined (because of bad name, wrong key or channel
    limit reached), but report an error and continue. And don't check
    the channel limit and don't report with "too many channels" when
    trying to join a channel that the client already is a member of.
  - ISON command: reply with the correct upper-/lowercase nicknames.
  - New configuration option "PAMIsOptional": when set, clients not
    sending a password are still allowed to connect: they won't become
    "identified" and keep the "~" character prepended to their supplied
    user name. See "man 5 ngircd.conf" for details.
  - Fixed handling of WHO commands. This fixes two bugs: "WHO <nick>"
    returned nothing at all if the user was "+i" (reported by Cahata,
    thanks) and "WHO <nick|nickmask>" returned channel names instead
    of "*" when the user was member of a (visible) channel.
  - Fixed some spelling errors in documentation and code comments
    (Thanks to Christoph Biedl).
  - contrib/Debian/control: Update and complete "Build-Depends" and
    update our Debian package descriptions with "official" ones.
  - Fixed typo in two error messages.
  - LUSERS reply: only count channels that are visible to the requesting
    client, so the existence of secret channels is no longer revealed by
    using LUSERS. Reported by Cahata, thanks!
  - Unknown user and channel modes no longer stop the mode parser, but
    are simply ignored. Therefore modes after the unknown one are now
    handled. This is how ircd2.10/ircd2.11/ircd-seven behave, at least.
    Reported by Cahata, thanks!
  - README: Update list of implemented commands.
  - Log better error messages when rejecting clients.
  - Implement IRC commands "GLINE" and "KLINE" to ban users. G-Lines are
    synchronized between server on peering, K-Lines are local only.
    If you use "*!<user>@<host>" or "*!*@<host>" masks, these connections
    are blocked even before the user is fully logged in (before PASS,
    NICK, and USER commands have been processed) and before the child
    processes for authentication are forked, so resource usage is smaller.
  - Xcode: update project file for Xcode 4.2 and define HAVE_GAI_STRERROR
    for Mac OS X Xcode builds.
  - ./configure: Fix logic and quoting of poll() detection code: only use
    poll() when poll.h exists as well.
  - Suppress 'Can't create pre-defined channel: invalid name: ""' message.
  - whois-test: handle local host name = "localhost.localdomain" using the
    pattern "localhost*" for valid local host names.
  - sample-ngircd.conf: show correct default for "PAM" variable: The
    default of "PAM" is "yes" when ngIRCd has been configured to use it,
    so show the correct default value in the sample configuration file.
    (Closes #119)
  - Update GPL 2 license text to current version.
  - Only close "unrelated" sockets in forked child processes: This fixes
    the problem that ngIRCd can't do any IDENT lookups because of the
    socket has already been closed in the child process.
    The bug has been introduced starting with ngIRCd 17 ... :-(
    (commit ID 6ebb31ab35e)
  - Added doc/Modes.txt: document modes supported by ngIRCd.
  - Implement user mode "R": indicates that the nickname of this user
    is "registered". This mode isn't handled by ngIRCd itself, but must
    be set and unset by IRC services like Anope.
  - Implement channel mode "R": only registered users (having the user
    mode "R" set) are allowed to join this channel.
  - Test suite: bind to loopback (127.0.0.1) interface only.
  - New 2nd message "Nickname too long" for error code 432.
  - Xcode: Mac OS X config.h: support 10.5 as well as 10.6/10.7 SDK.
  - Xcode: exclude more Xcode 4 specific directories in ".gitignore".
  - Disconnect directly linked servers sending QUIT. Without this,
    the server becomes removed from the network and the client list,
    but the connection isn't shut down at all ...
  - contrib/ngindent: detect "gindent" as GNU indent.
  - Handle unknown user and channel modes: these modes are saved and
    forwarded to other servers, but ignored otherwise.
  - Handle channel user modes 'a', 'h', and 'q' from remote servers.
    These channel user modes aren't used for anything at the moment,
    but ngIRCd knows that these three modes are "channel user modes"
    and not "channel modes", that is that these modes take an "nickname"
    argument. Like unknown user and channel modes, these modes are saved
    and forwarded to other servers, but ignored otherwise.
  - Correctly inform clients when other servers change their user modes.
    This is required for some services to work correctly.
  - Test suite: make getpid.sh work even when run as root.
  - Spoofed prefixes: close connection on non-server links only.
    On server-links, spoofed prefixes can happen because of the
    asynchronous nature of the IRC protocol. So don't break server-
    links, only log a message and ignore the command. (Closes #113)

ngIRCd 18 (2011-07-10)

  - Update timestamp of ngircd(8) manual page.
  - Add preliminary ngIRCd protocol module for Anope 1.9 to contrib/Anope/.
  - Don't register WHOWAS information when "MorePrivacy" option is in effect.

  ngIRCd 18~rc2 (2011-06-29)
  - Update documentation, fix some wording, and use a spellchecker :-)
  - ngircd.conf.5: strip "SSL" prefix from variables in [SSL] section.
  - ngircd.8: document debugging options.
  - GnuTLS: use 1024 bits as minimum size of the DH prime. This enables
    ngIRCd to accept incoming connections from other servers and clients
    that "only" use at least 1024 bits again, like ngIRCd 17 did (and no
    longer requires 2048 bits for incoming connections).

  ngIRCd 18~rc1 (2011-06-27)
  - PAM warning message: make clear which "Password" config option is ignored.
  - New configuration option "MorePrivacy" to "censor" some user information.
    When enabled, signon time and idle time is left out. Part and quit
    messages are made to look the same. WHOWAS requests are silently dropped.
    All of this is useful if one wish to conceal users that access the ngircd
    servers from TOR or I2P.
  - New configuration option "ScrubCTCP" to scrub incoming CTCP commands. If
    activated, the server silently drops incoming CTCP requests from both
    other servers and from users. The server that scrubs CTCP will not forward
    the CTCP requests to other servers in the network either, which can spell
    trouble if not every oper knows about the CTCP-scrubbing. Scrubbing CTCP
    commands also means that it is not possible to send files between users.
    There is one exception to the CTCP scrubbing performed: ACTION ("/me
    commands") requests are not scrubbed.
  - Display configuration errors more prominent on "--configtest".
  - Restructure ngIRCd configuration file: introduce new [Limits], [Options],
    and [SSL] sections. The intention of this restructuring is to make the
    [Global] section much cleaner, so that it only contains variables that
    most installations must adjust to the local requirements. All the optional
    variables are moved to [Limits], for configurable limits and timers of
    ngIRCd, and [Options], for optional features. All SSL-related variables
    are moved to [SSL] and the "SSL"-prefix is stripped. The old variables in
    the [Global] section are deprecated now, but are still recognized.
    => Don't forget to check your configuration, use "ngircd --configtest"!
  - New documentation "how to contribute": doc/Contributing.txt.
  - Slightly fix error handling when connecting to remote servers.
  - GnuTLS: bump DH-bitsize to 2048: this solves the problem that some clients
    refuse to connect to severs that only offer 1024. For interoperability it
    would be best to just use 4096 bits, but that takes minutes, even on
    current hardware ...
  - contrib/platformtest.sh: fix gcc version detection.
  - Avoid needlessly scary 'buffer overflow' messages: When the write buffer
    space grows too large, ngIRCd has to disconnect the client to avoid
    wasting too much memory, which is logged with a scary 'write buffer
    overflow' message. Change this to a more descriptive wording.
  - Require server prefixes for most commands on RFC2812 links. RFC1459 links
    (often used by services, for example) are not affected.
  - Mac OS X: update installer functionality, texts, and add our logo :-)
  - New configuration option "RequireAuthPing": PING-PONG on login. When
    enabled, this configuration option lets ngIRCd send a PING with an numeric
    "token" to clients logging in; and it will not become registered in the
    network until the client responds with the correct PONG.
  - New configuration option "NoticeAuth": send NOTICE AUTH on connect. When
    active, ngircd will send "NOTICE AUTH" messages on client connect time
    like e.g. snircd (QuakeNet) does.
  - Generate WALLOPS message on SQUIT from IRC operators; so SQUIT now behaves
    like CONNECT and DISCONNECT commands, when called by an IRC operator.
  - Allow servers to send more commands in the first 10 seconds ("burst"). This
    helps to speed up server login and network synchronization.
  - Add support for up to 3 targets in WHOIS queries, also allow up to one
    wildcard query from local hosts. Follows ircd 2.10 implementation rather
    than RFC 2812. At most 10 entries are returned per wildcard expansion.
  - ngircd.conf(5) manual page: describe types of configuration variables
    (booleans, text strings, integer numbers) and add type information to each
    variable description.
  - Don't use "the.net" in sample-ngircd.conf, use "example.net".
  - Terminate incoming connections on HTTP commands "GET" and "POST".
  - New configuration option "CloakHost": when set, this host name is used for
    every client instead of the real DNS host name (or IP address).
  - New configuration option "CloakUserToNick": when enabled, ngIRCd sets
    every clients' user name to their nickname and hides the user name
    supplied by the IRC client.
  - doc/Protocol.txt: Update description of the CHANINFO and WEBIRC commands.
  - Doxygen'ify (document) much more source files; code cleanup ...
  - Make write buffers bigger, but flush early. Before this change, a client
    got disconnected if the buffer flushing at 4k failed, now regular clients
    can store up to 32k and servers up 64k even if flushing is not possible at
    the moment. This enhances reliability on slow links.
  - Don't access possibly free'd CLIENT structure. Ooops.
  - Allow "Port = 0" in [Server] blocks. Port number 0 marks remote servers
    that try to connect to this daemon, but where this daemon never tries to
    establish a connection on its own: only incoming connections are allowed.
  - Configuration: fix 'Value of "..." is not a number!' for negative values.
  - Enable WHOIS command to return information about services.
  - Implement channel mode 'O': "IRC operators only". This channel mode is
    used on DALnet (bahamut), for example.
  - Remove support for ZeroConf/Bonjour/Rendezvous service registration
    including the "[No]ZeroConf" configuration option.
  - TOPIC command: test for channel admin rights correctly: this enables other
    servers, services and IRC operators to change channel topics, even when
    the client is not joined to this channel.
  - Deprecate NoXX-Options in ngircd.conf and move new variants into our new
    [Options] section: 'NoDNS=no' => 'DNS=yes', 'NoIdent=no' => 'Ident=yes',
    'NoPAM=no' => 'PAM=yes', and 'NoZeroConf=no' => 'ZeroConf=yes' (and
    vice-versa). The defaults are adjusted accordingly and the old variables
    in [Global] are still accepted, so there is no functional change.
  - Fix confusing "adding to invite list" debug messages: adding entries to
    ban list produced 'invite list' debug output ...
  - Don't throttle services and servers being registered.
  - Xcode: correctly sort files :-)
  - Don't assert() when searching a client for an invalid server token (this is
    only relevant when a trusted server on a server-server link sends invalid
    commands).

ngIRCd 17.1 (2010-12-19)

  - --configtest: remember if MOTD is configured by file or phrase
  - Enhance log messages when establishing server links a little bit
  - Reset ID of outgoing server link on DNS error correctly
  - Don't log critical (or worse) messages to stderr
  - Manual page ngircd(8): add SIGNALS section
  - Manual pages: update and simplify AUTHORS section

  - add doc/PAM.txt to distribution tarball
  - New numeric 329: get channel creation time on "MODE #chan" commands
  - Save channel creation time; new function Channel_CreationTime()

ngIRCd 17 (2010-11-07)

  - doc: change path names in sample-ngircd.conf depending on sysconfdir
  - Fix up generation and distribution of sample-ngircd.conf
  - contrib/ngircd-redhat.init: updated email address of Naoya Nakazawa
  - contrib/platformtest.sh: make command name quoting consistent

  ngIRCd 17~rc3 (2010-10-27)
  - Xcode builds: detect version number correctly, updated project file
    to use the Mac OS X 10.5.x SDK, disable pam_fail_delay() because it
    is only available starting with Mac OS X 10.6, and generate a default
    PAM configuration for the Mac OS X Installer.app package of ngIRCd.
  - Debian: updated standards version to 3.9.1, added libpam0g-dev to the
    dependencies, and install a default /etc/pam.d/ngircd allowing all logins.
  - Make contrib/platformtest.sh more portable.
  - Fix connect attempts to further IP addresses of outgoing server links.

  ngIRCd 17~rc2 (2010-10-25)
  - ZeroConf: include header files missing since commit a988bbc86a.
  - Generate ngIRCd version number from GIT tag.
  - Make source code compatible with ansi2knr again. This allows to compile
    ngIRCd using a pre-ANSI K&R C compiler again.
  - ./configure: check if C compiler can compile ISO Standard C.
  - ./configure: check support for C prototypes again.
  - Don't use PARAMS() macro for function implementations.
  - Added m68k/apple/aux3.0.1 (gcc 2.7.2) to doc/Platforms.txt.
  - Only try to set FD_CLOEXEC if this flag is defined.
  - Only use "__attribute__ ((unused))" if GCC >=2.8 is used.
  - doc/Makefile.am: don't set docdir, automake handles it already.

  ngIRCd 17~rc1 (2010-10-11)
  - New configuration option "NoZeroConf" to disable service registration at
    runtime even if ngIRCd is compiled with support for ZeroConf (e.g. using
    Howl, Avahi or on Mac OS X).
  - New configuration option "SyslogFacility" to define the syslog "facility"
    (the "target"), to which ngIRCd should send its log messages.
    Possible values are system dependent, but most probably "auth", "daemon",
    "user" and "local1" through "local7" are possible values; see syslog(3).
    Default is "local5" for historical reasons.
  - Dump the "internal server state" (configured servers, established
    connections and known clients) to the console or syslog when receiving
    the SIGUSR2 signal and debug mode is enabled.
  - Enable the daemon to disable and enable "debug mode" on runtime using
    signal SIGUSR1, when debug code is compiled in, not only on startup
    using the command line parameters.
  - Signal handler: added new 'delayed' signal handlers, including fallback
    to deprecated sysv API. And removed global NGIRCd_SignalRehash variable.
  - IO: add io_cloexec() to set close-on-exec flag.
  - ng_ipaddr.h: include required assert.h header.
  - Conn_SyncServerStruct(): test all connections; and work case insensitive
  - configure script: correctly indent IPv6 yes/no summary output.
  - Don't reset My_Connections[Idx].lastping when reading data, so the
    client lag debug-output is working again.
  - Implement user mode "x": host name cloaking (closes: #102).
  - Make configure switch "--docdir" work (closes: #108).
  - Reformat and update FAQ.txt a little bit.
  - INSTALL: mention SSL, IPv6, and changed handling of MotdFile.
  - Change MOTD file handling: ngIRCd now caches the contents of the MOTD
    file, so the daemon now requires a HUP signal or REHASH command to
    re-read the MOTD file when its content changed.
  - Startup: open /dev/null before chroot'ing the daemon.
  - Allow IRC ops to change channel modes even without OperServerMode set.
  - Allow IRC operators to use MODE command on any channel (closes: #100).
  - Added mailmap file for git-[short]log and git-blame.
  - Authenticated users should be registered without the "~" mark.
  - Set NoPAM=yes in configuration files used for the testsuite.
  - New configuration option "NoPAM" to disable PAM.
  - Implement asynchronous user authentication using PAM, please see the
    file doc/PAM.txt for details.
  - Resolver: Implement signal handler and catch TERM signals.
  - Don't set a penalty time when doing DNS lookups.
  - Add some documentation for using BOPM with ngIRCd, see doc/Bopm.txt.
  - Implement user mode "c": receive connect/disconnect NOTICEs. Note that
    this new mode requires the user to be an IRC operator.
  - ngircd.init: require "$network" and "$remote_fs" when stopping ngircd.
  - Show SSL status in WHOIS output, numeric 275.
  - Include correct header files when testing for arpa/inet.h (Closes: #105).
  - Don't access already freed memory in IRC_KILL().
  - Fix "beeing" typo ...
  - SSL/TLS: fix bogus "socket closed" error message.

ngIRCd 16 (2010-05-02)

  - doc/SSL: remove line continuation marker

  ngIRCd 16~rc2 (2010-04-25)
  - Updated some more copyright notices, it's 2010 already :-)
  - Only compile in Get_Error() if really needed
  - Fix gcc warning "ignoring return value of ..."
  - Include netinet/in_systm.h alongside netinet/ip.h
  - Include netinet/{in.h, in_systm.h} when checking for netinet/ip.h
  - Only include <netinet/in_systm.h> if it exists
  - Updated doc/Platforms.txt
  - Enhance connection statistics counters: display total number of served
    connections on daemon shutdown and when a new client connects using
    the new numeric RPL_STATSCONN (250).

  ngIRCd 16~rc1 (2010-03-25)
  - Various fixes to the build system and code cleanups.
  - contrib/platformtest.sh: Only show latest commit.
  - Updated doc/Platforms.txt, added new README-Interix.txt documenting
    how to tun ngIRCd on Microsoft Services for UNIX (MS SFU, MS SUA).
  - Updated links to the ngIRCd homepage (bug tracker, mailing list).
  - Added missing modes to USERMODES #define
  - Show our name (IRCD=ngIRCd) in ISUPPORT (005) numeric
  - Quote received messages of ERROR commands in log output.
  - ngircd.conf manual page: document missing "Password" variable.
  - Implement WEBIRC command used by some Web-IRC frontends. The password
    required to secure this command must be configured using the new
    "WebircPassword" variable in the ngircd.conf file.
  - Don't use port 6668 as example for both "Ports" and "SSLPorts".
  - Remove limit on max number of configured irc operators.
  - Only link "nsl" library when really needed.
  - A new channel mode "secure connections only" (+z) has been implemented:
    Only clients using a SSL encrypted connection to the server are allowed
    to join such a channel.
    But please note three things: a) already joined clients are not checked
    when setting this mode, b) IRC operators are always allowed to join
    every channel, and c) remote clients using a server not supporting this
    mode are not checked either and therefore always allowed to join.

ngIRCd 15 (2009-11-07)

  - "ngircd --configtest": print SSL configuration options even when unset.

  ngIRCd 15~rc1 (2009-10-15)
  - Do not add default listening port (6667) if SSL ports were specified, so
    ngIRCd can be configured to only accept SSL-encrypted connections now.
  - Enable IRC operators to use the IRC command SQUIT (instead of the already
    implemented but non-standard DISCONNECT command).
  - New configuration option "AllowRemoteOper" (disabled by default) that
    enables remote IRC operators to use the IRC commands SQUIT and CONNECT
    on the local server.
  - Mac OS X: fix test for packagemaker(1) tool in Makefile and use gcc 4.0
    for Mac OS X 10.4 compatibility in the Xcode project file.
  - Fix --with-{openssl|gnutls} to accept path names.
  - Fix LSB header of Debian init script.
  - Updated doc/Platforms.txt and include new script contrib/platformtest.sh
    to ease generating platform reports.
  - Fix connection information for already registered connections.
  - Enforce upper limit on maximum number of handled commands. This implements
    a throttling scheme: an IRC client can send up to 3 commands or 256 bytes
    per second before a one second pause is enforced.
  - Fix connection counter.
  - Fix a few error handling glitches for SSL/TLS connections.
  - Minor fixes to manual pages and documentation.

ngIRCd 14.1 (2009-05-05)

  - Security: fix remotely triggerable crash in SSL/TLS code.
  - BSD start script contrib/ngircd.sh has been renamed to ngircd-bsd.sh.

  - Debian: build ngircd-full-dbg package.
  - Allow ping timeout quit messages to show the timeout value.
  - Fix error handling on compressed links.
  - Fix server list announcement.
  - Do not remove host names from info text.

  - Updated Debian/Linux init script (see contrib/Debian/ngircd.init).
  - Allow creation of persistent modeless channels.
  - The INFO command reports the compile time now (if available).
  - Spell check and enhance ngIRCd manual pages.
  - Channel mode changes: break on syntax errors in MODE command.
  - Support individual channel keys for pre-defined channels: introduce
    new configuration variable "KeyFile" in [Channel] sections in ngircd.conf,
    here a file can be configured for each pre-defined channel which contains
    individual channel keys for different users.
  - Remove limit on maximum number of predefined channels in ngircd.conf.
  - Updated ngircd.spec file for building RPM packages.
  - Add new and missing files to Mac OS X Xcode project, and update project.
  - Reject masks with wildcard after last dot.
  - TLS/SSL: remove useless error message when ssl connection is closed.
  - Fix memory leak when a encrypted and compressed server link goes down.
    (closes bug #95, reported by Christoph, fiesh@fiesh.homeip.net)
  - Fix handling of channels containing dots.
    (closes bug #93, reported by Gonosz Csiga)

ngIRCd 13 (2008-12-25)

  - Updated documentation, especially doc/Services.txt and doc/SSL.txt.
  - Make the test suite work on OpenSolaris.

  ngIRCd 13~rc1 (2008-11-21):
  - New version number scheme :-)
  - Initial support for IRC services, using a RFC1459 style interface,
    tested with IRCServices (http://www.ircservices.za.net/) version 5.1.13.
    For this to work, ngIRCd now supports server-server links conforming
    to RFC 1459. New ngircd.conf(5) option: ServiceMask.
  - Support for SSL-encrypted server-server and client-server links using
    OpenSSL (configure: --with-openssl) or GNUTLS (configure: --with-gnutls).
    New ngircd.conf(5) options: SSLPorts, SSLKeyFile, SSLKeyFilePassword,
    SSLCertFile, SSLDHFile, and SSLConnect.
  - Server local channels have been implemented, prefix "&", that are only
    visible to users of the same server and are not visible in the network.
    In addition ngIRCd creates a "special" channel &SERVER on startup and logs
    all the messages to it that a user with mode +s receives.
  - New make target "osxpkg" to build a Mac OS X installer package.
  - Debug mode: enable support for GNU libc memory tracing (see mtrace(3)).
  - SysV init script: use LSB logging functions, if available.
  - Added some more FAQ entries (regarding logging and IRC operators).
  - Allow IRC operators to overwrite channel limits.
  - Support for enhanced PRIVMSG and NOTICE message targets.
  - More tests have been added to the test-suite ("make check"), and two
    servers are started for testing server-server linking.
  - Added a timestamp to log messages to the console.
  - New configuration option "NoIdent" to disable IDENT lookups even if the
    daemon is compiled with IDENT support.

ngIRCd 0.12.1 (2008-07-09)

  - Allow mixed line terminations (CR+LF/CR/LF) in non-RFC-compliant mode
  - Don't allow stray \r or \n in command parameters
  - --configtest: return non-zero exit code if there are errors
  - Update ngIRCd manual pages
  - Add option aliases -V (for --version) and -h (for --help).
  - Fix 'no-ipv6' compile error.
  - Make Listen parameter a comma-separated list of addresses. This also
    obsoletes ListenIPv4 and ListenIPv6 options. If Listen is unset, it
    is treated as Listen="::,0.0.0.0".
    Note: ListenIPv4 and ListenIPv6 options are still recognized,
    but ngircd will print a warning if they are used in the config file.

ngIRCd 0.12.0 (2008-05-13)

  - Fix Bug: 85: "WHO #SecretChannel" that user is not a member of now returns
    proper RPL_ENDOFWHO_MSG instead of nothing. (Ali Shemiran)
  - Fix compile on FreeBSD 5.4 and AIX.
  - If bind() fails, also print IP address and not just the port number.

  ngIRCd 0.12.0-pre2 (2008-04-29)
  - IPv6: Add config options to disable ipv4/ipv6 support.
  - Don't include doc/CVS.txt in distribution archive, use doc/GIT.txt now!
  - Documentation: get rid of some more references to CVS, switch to GIT.
  - Get rid of cvs-version.* and CVSDATE definition.
  - Report ERR_NOTONCHANNEL when trying to part a channel one is not member of.
  - Testsuite: remove erroneous ConfUID setting in config file.

  ngIRCd 0.12.0-pre1 (2008-04-20)
  - Include Mac OS X Xcode project in distribution archives.
  - Do not exit on SIGHUP or /REHASH if the config file cannot opened.
  - Add IPv6 support.
  - Install a LaunchDaemon script to start/stop ngIRCd on Mac OS X.
  - Implemented IRC commands INFO, SUMMON (dummy), and USERS (dummy) and
    enhanced test suite to check these commands. (Dana Dahlstrom)
  - RPL_WHOREPLY messages generated by IRC_WHO didn't include flags (*,@,+).
    (Dana Dahlstrom)
  - IRC_WHO now supports search patterns and will test this against user
    nickname/server name/host name, etc. as required by RFC 2812, Section 3.6.1.
    (reported by Dana Dahlstrom)
  - Add test cases for "WHO" command. (Dana Dahlstrom)
  - Implement RFC 2812 handling of "0" argument to 'JOIN': must be treated
    as if the user had sent PART commands for all channels the user is a
    member of. (Dana Dahlstrom)
  - Allow NOTICEs to be sent to a channel. (Fabian Schlager)

ngIRCd 0.11.1 (2008-02-26)

  - Fix sending of JOIN commands between servers when remote server appended
    mode flags. (Rolf Eike Beer) [from HEAD]
  - Send "G" instead of "H" flag in WHO replies. (reported by Dana Dahlstrom)
  - Under some circumstances ngIRCd issued channel MODE message with a
    trailing space. (Dana Dahlstrom) [from HEAD]

ngIRCd 0.11.0 (2008-01-15)

  ngIRCd 0.11.0-pre2 (2008-01-07)
  - SECURITY: IRC_PART could reference invalid memory, causing
    ngircd to crash [from HEAD]. (CVE-2008-0285)

  ngIRCd 0.11.0-pre1 (2008-01-02)
  - Use dotted-decimal IP address if host name is >= 64.
  - Add support for /STAT u (server uptime) command.
  - New [Server] configuration Option "Bind" allows to specify
    the source IP address to use when connecting to remote server.
  - New configuration option "MaxNickLength" to specify the allowed maximum
    length of user nicknames. Note: must be unique in an IRC network!
  - Enhanced the IRC+ protocol to support an enhanced "server handshake" and
    enable server to recognize numeric 005 (ISUPPORT) and 376 (ENDOFMOTD).
    See doc/Protocol.txt for details.
  - Re-added doc/SSL.txt to distribution -- got lost somewhere!?
  - Fixes the wrong logging output when nested servers are introduced
    to the network as well as the wrong output of the LINKS command.
  - Update Mac OS X Xcode project file for Xcode 3.
  - Adjust test suite to be usable on HP/UX 11.11 :-)
  - Fix code to compile using K&R C compiler and ansi2kr again.
  - New config option NoDNS: Disables DNS lookups when clients connect.
  - Fixed propagation of channel mode 'P' on server links.
  - Numeric 317: implemented "signon time" (displayed in WHOIS result).
  - Fixed code that prevented GCC 2.95 to compile ngIRCd.
  - Adjust path names in manual pages according to "./configure" settings.
  - Added new server configuration option "Passive" for "Server" blocks to
    disable automatic outgoing connections (similar to -p option to ngircd,
    but only for the specified server). (Tassilo Schweyer)
  - Don't connect to a server if a connection to another server within the
    same group is already in progress.
  - Added support for the WALLOPS command. Usage is restricted to IRC
    operators.

ngIRCd 0.10.4 (2008-01-07)

  - SECURITY: IRC_PART could reference invalid memory, causing
    ngircd to crash [from HEAD]. (CVE-2008-0285)

ngIRCd 0.10.3 (2007-08-01)

  - SECURITY: Fixed a severe bug in handling JOIN commands, which could
    cause the server to crash. Thanks to Sebastian Vesper, <net@veoson.net>.
    (CVE-2007-6062)

ngIRCd 0.10.2 (2007-06-08)

  ngIRCd 0.10.2-pre2 (2007-05-19)
  - Server links are allowed to use larger write buffers now (up to 50 KB).

  ngIRCd 0.10.2-pre1 (2007-05-05)
  - Fix compressed server links (broken since 0.10.0).
  - Predefined Channel configuration now allows specification of channel key
    (mode k) and maximum user count (mode l).
  - When using epoll() IO interface, compile in the select() interface as
    well and fall back to it when epoll() isn't available on runtime.
  - New configure option "--without-select" to disable select() IO API
    (even when using epoll(), see above).
  - Added support for IO APIs "poll()" and "/dev/poll".
  - Reorganized internal handling of invite and ban lists.

ngIRCd 0.10.1 (2006-12-17)

  - Fixed validation of server names containing digits.
  - Update the "info text" of the local server after re-reading configuration.
  - Changed Numerics 265 and 266 to follow ircd 2.11.x "standards".
  - Allow PASS syntax defined in RFC 1459 for server links, too.
  - Enhanced ISUPPORT message (005 numeric).
  - New configuration option "PredefChannelsOnly": if set, clients can only
    join predefined channels.
  - Code cleanups: use "LogDebug(...)" instead of "Log(LOG_DEBUG, ...)", use
    "strcspn()", unsigned vs. signed, use "const", fix whitespaces, ...

ngIRCd 0.10.0 (2006-10-01)

  - Fixed file handle leak when daemon is not able to send MOTD to a client.

  ngIRCd 0.10.0-pre2 (2006-09-09)
  - Fixed build problems with GCC option -fstack-protector.
  - Minor documentation updates.

  ngIRCd 0.10.0-pre1 (2006-08-02)
  - Validate "ServerName" (see RFC 2812, section 2.3.1).
  - Enhanced DIE to accept a single parameter ("comment text") which is sent
    to all locally connected clients before the server goes down.
  - The ngIRCd handles time shifts backwards more gracefully now (the
    timeout handling doesn't disconnect clients by mistake any more).
  - Internal: Restructured connection handling (the connection ID is equal
    to the file descriptor of the connection).
  - Internal: Simplified resolver code.
  - JOIN now supports more than one channel key at a time.
  - Implemented numeric "333": Time and user name who set a channel topic.
  - Enhanced the handler for PING and PONG commands: fix forwarding and enable
    back-passing of a client supplied additional argument of PING.
  - Changed handling of timeouts for unregistered connections: don't reset
    the counter if data is received and disconnect clients earlier.
  - Removed unnecessary #define of "LOCAL", now use plain C "static" instead.
  - Channel topics are no longer limited to 127 characters: now the only limit
    is the maximum length of an IRC command, i. e. 512 bytes (in practice, this
    limits the topic to about 490 characters due to protocol overhead).
  - Reverse DNS lookup code now checks the result by doing an additional
    lookup to prevent spoofing.
  - Added new IO layer which (optionally) supports epoll() and kqueue() in
    addition to the select() interface.

ngIRCd 0.9.2 (2005-10-15)

  - Fixed a bug that could cause the daemon to crash when outgoing server
    connections can't be established.
  - Fixed a bug that caused the daemon to leak file descriptors when no
    resolver subprocesses could be created.
  - Fixed server NOTICEs to users with "s" mode ("server messages").
  - Fixed a format string bug in "connection statistics" messages to clients.

ngIRCd 0.9.1 (2005-08-03)

  - The KILL command killed much more than desired (including server links!)
    when the target user is connected to a remote server. Bug introduced in
    ngIRCd 0.9.0 ...  Reported by <qssl@fastmail.fm>, Thanks!
  - Changed some constants to be "signed" (instead of unsigned) to solve
    problems with old (pre-ANSI) compilers.

ngIRCd 0.9.0 (2005-07-24)

  ngIRCd 0.9.0-pre1 (2005-07-09)
  - Fixed maximum length of user names, now allow up to 9 characters.
  - Cut off oversized IRC messages that should be sent to the network instead
    of shutting down the (wrong) connection.
  - Don't generate error messages for unknown commands received before the
    client is registered with the server (like the original ircd).
  - Never run with root privileges but always switch the user ID.
  - Make "netsplit" messages RFC compliant.
  - Fix handling of QUIT Messages: send only one message, even if the client
    is member of multiple channels.
  - Don't exit server if closing of a socket fails; instead ignore it and
    pray that this will be "the right thing" ...
  - Implemented the IRC function "WHOWAS".
  - Don't enable assert() calls when not ./configure'd with --enable-debug.
  - Fixed ./configure test for TCP Wrappers: now it runs on Mac OS X as well.
  - Enhanced configure script: now you can pass an (optional) search path
    to all --with-XXX parameters, e. g. "--with-ident=/opt/ident".
  - Removed typedefs for the native C data types.
    Use stdbool.h / inttypes.h if available.
  - New configuration option "OperServerMode" to enable a workaround needed
    when running an network with ircd2 servers and "OperCanUseMode" enabled
    to prevent the ircd2 daemon to drop mode changes of IRC operators.
    Patch by Florian Westphal, <westphal@foo.fh-furtwangen.de>.
  - Implemented support for "secret channels" (channel mode "s").
  - New configuration option "Mask" for [Operator] sections to limit OPER
    commands to users with a specific IRC mask. Patch from Florian Westphal.
  - Write "error file" (/tmp/ngircd-XXX.err) only if compiled with debug
    code ("--enable-debug") and running as daemon process.
  - Don't create version information string each time a client connects
    but instead on server startup. By Florian Westphal.
  - New configuration variable "PidFile", section "[Global]": if defined,
    the server writes its process ID (PID) to this file. Default: off.
    Idea of Florian Westphal, <westphal@foo.fh-furtwangen.de>.
  - Code cleanups from Florian Westphal, <westphal@foo.fh-furtwangen.de>.
  - Raised the maximum length of passwords to 20 characters.
  - Fixed a memory leak when resizing the connection pool and realloc()
    failed. Now we don't fall back to malloc(), which should be sane anyway.
    Patch from Florian Westphal, <westphal@foo.fh-furtwangen.de>.
  - Added support for the Howl (http://www.porchdogsoft.com/products/howl/)
    Rendezvous API, in addition to the API of Apple (Mac OS X). The available
    API will be autodetected when you call "./configure --with-rendezvous".
  - Made ngIRCd compile on HP/UX 10.20 with native HP pre-ANSI C compiler and
    most probably other older C compilers on other systems.
  - When the daemon should switch to another user ID (ServerID is defined in
    the configuration file) and is not running in a chroot environment, it
    changes its working directory to the home directory of this user. This
    should enable the system to write proper core files when not running with
    root privileges ...

ngIRCd 0.8.3 (2005-02-03)

  - Fixed a bug that could case a root exploit when the daemon is compiled
    to do IDENT lookups and is logging to syslog. Bug discovered by CoKi,
    <coki@nosystem.com.ar>, thanks a lot!
    (CVE-2005-0226; http://www.nosystem.com.ar/advisories/advisory-11.txt)

ngIRCd 0.8.2 (2005-01-26)

  - Added doc/SSL.txt to distribution.
  - Fixed a buffer overflow that could cause the daemon to crash. Bug found
    by Florian Westphal, <westphal@foo.fh-furtwangen.de>. (CVE-2005-0199)
  - Fixed a possible buffer underrun when reading the MOTD file. Thanks
    to Florian Westphal, <westphal@foo.fh-furtwangen.de>.
  - Fixed detection of IRC lines which are too long to send. Detected by
    Florian Westphal, <westphal@foo.fh-furtwangen.de>.
  - Fixed return values of our own implementation of strlcpy(). The code has
    been taken from rsync and they fixed it, but we didn't until today :-/
    It has only been used when the system didn't implement strlcpy by itself,
    not on "modern" systems. Florian Westphal, <westphal@foo.fh-furtwangen.de>.

ngIRCd 0.8.1 (2004-12-25)

  - Autoconf: Updated config.guess and config.sub
  - Added some more debug code ...
  - Fixed wrong variable names in output of "ngircd --configtest".
  - Debian: Fixed the name of the "default file" in the init script for
    ngircd-full packages. And do the test if the binary is executable after
    reading this file.
  - Enhanced the "test suite": please have a look at src/testsuite/README!

ngIRCd 0.8.0 (2004-06-26)

  - Fixed wrong buffer size calculation for results of the resolver.

  ngircd 0.8.0-pre2 (2004-05-16)
  - Enhanced logging to console when running in "no-detached mode": added
    PID and log messages of resolver sub-processes.
  - Fixed host name lookups when using IDENT user lookups.
  - "make clean" and "make maintainer-clean" remove more files now.

  ngIRCd 0.8.0-pre1 (2004-05-07)
  - Two new configuration options: "ChrootDir" and "MotdPhrase", thanks to
    Benjamin Pineau <ben@zouh.org>. Now you can force the daemon to change
    its root and working directory to something "safe". MotdPhrase is used
    to define an "MOTD string" instead of a whole file, useful if the
    "real" MOTD file would be outside the "jail".
  - INVITE- and BAN-lists become synchronized between IRC+ servers when
    establishing new connections, if the peer supports this as well.
  - Reorganized autogen.sh and configure scripts.
  - Fixed a wrong assert() which could cause the daemon to exit spuriously
    when closing down connections.
  - Better logging of decompression errors returned by zlib.
  - Servers other than the destination server didn't clean up the invite
    list of an "invite-only" channel properly when an INVITE'd user joined.
  - Changed the reply of the MODE command to match the syntax of the
    original ircd exactly: the unnecessary but missing ":" before the last
    parameter has been added.
  - Fixed TRACE: don't output "Serv" lines for ourself; display more info.
  - Results of the resolver (host names and IDENT names) are discarded after
    the client is successfully registered with the server.
  - Better logging while establishing and shutting down connections.
  - The type of service (TOS) of all sockets is set to "interactive" now.
  - Added short command line option "-t" as alternative to "--configtest".
  - Added optional support for "IDENT" lookups on incoming connections. You
    have to enable this function with the ./configure switch "--with-ident".
    The default is not to do IDENT lookups.

ngIRCd 0.7.7 (2004-02-05)

  - The info text ("real name") of users is set to "-" if none has been
    specified using the USER command (e. g. "USER user * * :"). Reason:
    the original ircd doesn't like empty ones and would KILL such users.
  - Fixed (optional) TCP Wrapper test which was broken and could result in
    false results. Thanks to Fuminori Tanizaki <tany@mcnet.ad.jp>!
  - Removed "USE_" prefixes of configuration #defines.

ngIRCd 0.7.6 (2003-12-05)

  - Fixed abort() ("server crash") when INVITE'ing users to nonexistent
    channels. Bug found by <hiddenx@wp.pl>.
  - Extended version numbering of CVS versions (added date).
  - Enhanced/fixed doc/Protocol.txt;

ngIRCd 0.7.5 (2003-11-07)

  - Fixed ban behavior: users which are banned from a channel can't no
    longer send PRIVMSG's to this channel (fixes Bug #47).
  - Fixed and enhanced the "penalty handling" of the server: commands that
    require more resources block the client for a short time.
  - Changed the internal time resolution to one second.
  - New configuration variable "MaxConnectionsIP" to limit the number of
    simultaneous connections from a single IP that the server will accept.
    This configuration options lowers the risk of denial of service attacks
    (DoS), the default is 5 connections per client IP.
  - Fixed build problems under Mac OS X 10.3.
  - Use "-pipe" when compiling with gcc, speeds things up a little :-)
  - Added new configuration variable "Listen" to bind all listening
    sockets of the server to a single IP address.
  - Suppress misleading error message of diff during make run.
  - Enhanced test-suite and made it work on GNU/Hurd.
  - Fixed minor typo in debug output :-)

ngIRCd 0.7.1 (2003-07-18)

  - Included files to build Debian packages (located in "debian/").
  - Updated config.guess and config.sub to newer upstream versions.
  - NJOIN propagates user channel modes correctly again ... Upsa.
  - Made Makefile more compatible with "make -j<n>".
  - Added support for GNU/Hurd.
  - Fixed a compiler warning related to an unnecessary assert().
  - Enhanced VERSION command when using debug versions.

ngIRCd 0.7.0 (2003-05-01)

  - "ServerName" is checked better now: a dot (".") is required.
  - The KILL command verifies and logs more parameters.

  ngIRCd 0.7.0-pre2 (2003-04-27)
  - CVS build system fixes (made autogen.sh more portable).
  - Fixed compilation and test-suite on Solaris (tested with 2.6).
  - New documentation file "doc/Platforms.txt" describing the status of
    ngIRCd on the various tested platforms.
  - Test for broken GCC on Mac OS X and disable "-pedantic" in this case.
  - Disable "-ansi" on Cygwin: system headers are incompatible.
  - The server tried to connect to other servers only once when DNS or
    socket failures occurred.
  - Fixed --configtest: There is no variable "ServerPwd", it's "Password".

  ngIRCd 0.7.0-pre1 (2003-04-22)
  - New signal handler (more secure, actions are executed outside).
  - GCC: the compiler is now called with more warning options enabled.
  - Replaced a lot of str[n]cpy(), str[n]cat() and sprintf() calls with the
    more secure functions strlcpy(), strlcat() and snprintf(). On systems
    that don't support strlcpy() and strlcat(), these functions are included
    in the libngportab now (with prototypes in portab.h).
  - If the server can't close a socket, it panics now. This is an error that
    can't occur during normal operation so there is something broken.
  - The order of log messages during disconnects is more "natural" now ;-)
  - Cleaned up handling of server configuration structures: modifying and
    removing servers during runtime works more reliable now.
  - Compression code from "conn.[ch]" is now found in new "conn-zip.[ch]"
  - Moved some connection functions from "conn.[ch]" to "conn-func.[ch]".
  - New command CONNECT to enable and add server links. The syntax is not
    RFC-compatible: use "CONNECT <name> <port>" to enable and connect an
    configured server and "CONNECT <name> <port> <host> <mypwd> <peerpwd>"
    to add a new server (ngIRCd tries to connect new servers only once!).
  - Added DISCONNECT command ("DISCONNECT <name>") to disable servers.
  - Restructured the documentation: Now the main language is English. The
    German documentation has been removed (until there is a maintainer).
  - Enhanced killing of users caused by a nickname collision.
  - Better error detection for status code ("numerics") forwarding.
  - Moved tool functions to own library: "libngtool".
  - New command TRACE (you can trace only servers at the moment).
  - New command HELP that lists all understood commands.
  - There should no longer remain "unknown connections" (see e.g. LUSERS)
    if an outgoing server link can't be established.
  - Added AC_PREREQ(2.50) to configure.in for better autoconf compatibility.
  - Conn_Close() now handles recursive calls for the same link correctly.
  - ngIRCd can register itself with Rendezvous: to enable support pass the
    new switch "--with-rendezvous" to configure.
  - Added support for TCP Wrappers library: pass "--with-tcp-wrappers" to
    configure to enable it.
  - Changed some configure options to use "--with"/"--without" as prefix
    instead of "--enable"/"--disable": "--without-syslog", "--without-zlib",
    "--with-tcp-wrappers", and "--with-rendezvous".
  - Better error reporting to clients on connect.
  - Enhanced manual pages ngircd(8) and ngircd.conf(5).
  - Documentation is now installed in $(datadir)/doc/ngircd.
  - Enhanced handling of NJOIN in case of nick collisions.

ngIRCd 0.6.1 (2003-01-21)

  - Fixed KILL: you can't crash the server by killing yourself any more,
    ngIRCd no longer sends a QUIT to other servers after the KILL, and you
    can kill only valid users now.
  - The server no longer forwards commands to ordinary users, instead it
    answers with the correct error message ("no such server") now.
  - WHOIS commands weren't always forwarded as requested.
  - The server sets a correct default AWAY message now when propagating
    between servers (bug introduced in 0.6.0).
  - Fixed up and enhanced CHANINFO command: channel keys and user limits
    are synchronized between servers now, too.
  - MODE returns the key and user limit for channel members correctly now.
  - Non-members of a channel could crash the server when trying to change
    its modes or modes of its members.
  - The server didn't validate weather a target user is a valid channel
    member when changing his channel user modes which could crash ngIRCd.


Older changes (sorry, only available in German language):

ngIRCd 0.6.0, 24.12.2002

  ngIRCd 0.6.0-pre2, 23.12.2002
  - neuer Numeric 005 ("Features") beim Connect.
  - LUSERS erweitert: nun wird die maximale Anzahl der lokalen und globalen
    Clients, die dem Server bzw. im Netzwerk seit dem letzten (Re-)Start
    dem Server gleichzeitig bekannt waren, angezeigt.

  ngIRCd 0.6.0-pre1, 18.12.2002
  - beim Schliessen einer Verbindung zeigt der Server nun vor dem ERROR
    noch eine Statistik ueber die empfangene und gesendete Datenmenge an.
  - der Server wartet bei einer eingehenden Verbindung nun laenger auf den
    Resolver (4 Sekunden), wenn das Ergebnis eintrifft setzt er aber den
    Login sofort fort (bisher wurde immer mind. 1 Sekunde gewartet).
  - Connection-Strukturen werden nun "pool-weise" verwaltet; der Pool wird
    bei Bedarf bis zu einem konfigurierten Limit vergroessert.
  - Mit der neuen Konfigurationsvariable "MaxConnections" (Sektion "Global")
    kann die maximale Anzahl gleichzeitiger Verbindungen begrenzt werden.
    Der Default ist -1, "unlimitiert".
  - der Server erkennt nun, ob bereits eine eingehende Verbindung von einem
    Peer-Server besteht und versucht dann nicht mehr, selber eine eigene
    ausgehende Verbindung zu diesem auufzubauen. Dadurch kann nun auf beiden
    Servern in der Konfiguration ein Port fuer den Connect konfiguriert
    werden (beide Server versuchen sich dann gegenseitig zu connectieren).
  - Test-Suite und Dokumentation an A/UX angepasst.
  - unter HP-UX definiert das configure-Script nun _XOPEN_SOURCE_EXTENDED.
  - Server identifizieren sich nun mit asynchronen Passwoertern, d.h. das
    Passwort, welches A an B schickt, kann ein anderes sein als das, welches
    B als Antwort an A sendet. In der Konfig.-Datei, Abschnitt "Server",
    wurde "Password" dazu durch "MyPassword" und "PeerPassword" ersetzt.
  - Der Server kann nun zur Laufzeit die Konfiguration neu einlesen: dies
    macht er nach dem Befehl REHASH oder wenn ein HUP-Signal empfangen wird.
  - Channel-Mode "P" ("persistent") kann nur noch von IRC-Operatoren gesetzt
    werden. Grund: User koennen den Server sonst leicht "Channel-Flooden".
  - MOTD kann nun an andere Server geforwarded werden.
  - IRC-Befehl "TIME" implementiert.
  - Server-Server-Links koennen nun komprimiert werden, dazu wird die zlib
    (www.zlib.org) benoetigt. Unterstuetzt die Gegenseite die Komprimierung
    nicht, wird automatisch unkomprimiert kommuniziert. Das Verfahren ist
    kompatibel mit dem Original-ircd 2.10.3, d.h. beide Server koennen
    miteinander ueber komprimiert Links kommunizieren.
  - Handling der Schreibpuffer umgestellt: Server sollte schneller arbeiten.
  - Prefix-Fehler werden besser protokolliert (mit verursachendem Befehl).
  - SQUIT wird nicht mehr doppelt an andere Server weitergeleitet.
  - Der Server versucht nun vor dem Schliessen einer Verbindung Daten, die
    noch im Schreibpuffer stehen, zu senden.
  - Source in weiteres Modul "irc-info" aufgespalten.
  - Konfigurationsvariablen werden besser validiert: Laengen, Zahlen, ...
  - neuen Befehl STATS begonnen: bisher unterstuetzt wird "l" und "m".
  - bei ISON und USERHOST fehlte im Ergebnis-String der korrekte Absender.
  - IRC Operatoren koennen nun mit KILL User toeten. Achtung: ein Grund muss
    zwingend als zweiter Parameter angegeben werden!
  - neue Konfigurations-Variable "MaxJoins": Hiermit kann die maximale Zahl
    der Channels, in denen ein User Mitglied sein kann, begrent werden.
  - neuer, deutlich flexiblerer Parser fuer den MODE Befehl.
  - neue Channel-Modes l (User-Limit) und k (Channel-Key) implementiert.

ngIRCd 0.5.4, 24.11.2002

  - Fehler-Handling von connect() gefixed: der Server kann sich nun auch
    unter A/UX wieder zu anderen verbinden.
  - in den Konfigurationsvariablen ServerUID und ServerGID kann nun nicht
    nur die numerische ID, sondern auch der Name des Users bzw. der Gruppe
    verwendet werden. Beim Start des Daemons wird nun beides angezeigt.
  - Besseres Logging von Prefix-Fehlern.
  - angenommene Sockets werden nun korrekt auf "non-blocking" konfiguriert,
    beim Senden und Empfangen werden Blockierungen besser abgefangen.
  - RPL_UMODEIS hat Code 221, nicht 211 ... *argl*
  - select() in Try_Write() hat falschen (keinen!) Timeout verwendet;
    die "Zeit-Aufloesung" des Servers sind zudem nun 2 Sekunden (TIME_RES).
    Insgesamt sollte die Reaktionszeit des Server nun besser sein.

ngIRCd 0.5.3, 08.11.2002

  - NOTICE liefert nun wirklich nie mehr einen Fehler, auch dann nicht,
    wenn der sendende Client noch gar nicht registriert ist.
  - ein "schneller Server-Reconnect" wird nur noch dann versucht, wenn die
    Verbindung zuvor ordentlich (="lange genug") in Ordnung war; somit also
    nicht meht, wenn der Peer-Server gleich beim Connect ein ERROR liefert.
    Das vermeidet "Connect-Orgien".
  - einige Datentypen aufgeraumt: z.B. sind viele INT32s nun LONGs. Das ist
    auf Platformen mit 8-Byte-Integern kompatibler.
  - RPL_YOURHOST_MSG ist nun ircII- und RFC-kompatibel ;-)
  - Segfault unter hoher Netzaktivitaet behoben: in Conn_Close() wird die
    Connection-Struktur nun frueher als "ungueltig" markiert.

ngIRCd 0.5.2, 04.10.2002

  - Buffer Overflow in Read_Resolver_Result() behoben.
  - Format-String-Bugs, die zum Abbruch des Servers fuehrten, behoben.
  - Maximale Laenge eines IRC-Prefix wurde falsch berechnet.

ngIRCd 0.5.1, 03.10.2002

  - in RPL_YOURHOST_MSG wurde ein fehlerhafter Versionsstring geliefert.
  - Test-Suite: start-server.sh, stop-server.sh und stress-server.sh koennen
    nun "manuell" von der Kommandozeile gestartet werden, stress-server.sh
    startet per Default nur noch 5 Sessions, eine andere Zahl kann auf der
    Kommandozeile uebergeben werden (Syntax: "stress-server.sh <count>").
  - In bestimmten Faellen hat der Server versucht auf einen bereits wieder
    geschlossenen Socket Daten zu schreiben; das fuehrte zu einem Abbruch des
    Servers durch ein assert(). Nun wird geprueft, ob der Socket noch ok ist.
  - im "contrib"-Verzeichnis befindet sich nun eine RPM-Spec-Datei, aus den
    .tar.gz's koennen nun mit "rpm -ta <archiv>" RPM's erzeugt werden. Danke
    an Sean Reifschneider <jafo@tummy.com>!
  - Syntax von RPL_MYINFO_MSG korrigiert: liefert nun vier Parameter.

ngIRCd 0.5.0, 20.09.2002

  - Dokumentation aktualisiert.
  - Fehler bei Validierung von "AdminInfo2" behoben.
  - Test der Flags fuer "ps" in der Testsuite verbessert, ist nun zu mehr
    Plattformen kompatibler.

  ngIRCd 0.5.0-pre2, 17.09.2002
  - Fix in IRC_WriteStrServersPrefix() war "badly broken" -- behoben.

  ngIRCd 0.5.0-pre1, 16.09.2002
  - Manual-Pages ngircd.8 und ngircd.conf.5 begonnen.
  - Wird der Netzwerk-Sniffer aktiviert (--sniffer), so schaltet der
    ngIRCd nun automatisch in den Debug-Modus.
  - auf Systemen, die inet_aton() nicht kennen (wie z.B. A/UX), kann der
    ngIRCd nun dennoch auch aktiv Server-Links aufbauen.
  - h_errno wird auf Systemen, die das nicht kennen (wie z.B. HP-UX 10.20)
    nicht mehr verwendet. Somit compiliert der ngIRCd nun auch dort :-)
  - um auf dem Ziel-System nicht vorhandene Funktionen nachzubilden wird nun
    die "libngportab" erzeugt; genutzt wird dies bisher fuer vsnprintf().
    Nun compiliert der ngIRCd auch unter Solaris 2.5.1.
  - "persistente Channels" (Mode 'P') implementiert: diese koennen in der
    Konfigurationsdatei definiert werden (Sektion "Channel", vgl. Beispiel-
    Konfiguration "sample-ngircd.conf") und bleiben auch dann bestehen,
    wenn kein User mehr im Channel ist. Zu Channel-Operatoren werden bisher
    nur IRC-Operatoren, die den Channel betreten. Die persistenten Channels
    werden durch das Flag "P" gelennzeichnet, welches normal durch Channel-
    Op's gesetzt und geloescht werden kann.
  - bei "--configtest" werden keine leere Abschnitte mehr ausgegeben.
  - Source in weitere Module aufgespalten: lists, irc-op und resolve.
  - #include's aufgeraeumt: Header includieren keine anderen mehr.
  - KICK implementiert (bisher kann nur ein User aus einem Channel geckicked
    werden, Listen, wir im RFC vorgesehen, werden bisher nicht unterstuetzt).
  - INVITE, den Channel-Mode "i" sowie Invite-Lists ueber den MODE-Befehl
    (setzen, erfragen und loeschen) implementiert.
  - Source an ansi2knr fuer pre-ANSI-Compiler angepasst; ansi2knr in Source-
    Tree aufgenommen und in Build-System integriert; der ngIRCd compiliert
    nun z.B. unter A/UX mit dem nativen Compiler von Apple.
  - TOPIC lieferte bei unbekanntem Channel einen falschen Fehlercode.
  - LIST versteht nun Wildcards und kann an andere Server geforwarded werden.
  - wurde ein KILL fuer nicht-lokale Clients empfangen, so wurden die
    Verwaltungs-Strukturen nicht korrekt freigegeben.
  - empfangene NJOIN's wurden "zerhackt" an andere Server weitergegeben.
  - neue Konfigurationsoption "OperCanUseMode" (Sektion "Global"):
    ist sie aktiv, koennen IRC-Operatoren immer Channel-Modes setzen.
  - Dokumentation des neuen IRC+-Protokolls begonnen: doc/Protocol.txt
  - Protokoll- und Server-ID bei PASS-Befehlen auf neues Format umgestellt;
    bei empfangenen PASS-Befehlen werden diese zudem nun auch ausgewertet.
    Die unterstuetzten Flags sind in doc/Protocol.txt beschrieben.
  - mit dem neuen Befehl CHANINFO synchronisieren Server, die das IRC+-
    Protokoll unterstuetzen, Channel-Modes und Topics.
  - neue Option "--disable-ircplus" fuer das configure-Script, um das
    IRC+-Protokoll abzuschalten (per Default ist es aktiviert).
  - Ban-Lists (setzen, erfragen und loeschen) implementiert.
  - wird der Server mit "-n"/"--nodaemon" gestartet, so werden keine Mel-
    dungen mehr ueber Syslog ausgegeben, sondern nur noch auf der Konsole.
  - "Test-Suite" begonnen (in "make check" integriert): Dabei wird ein
    speziell konfigurierter Server auf Port 6789 gestartet, mit dem dann
    einige Tests durchgefuehrt werden (u.a. "Stress-Test" mit 50 Clients).
  - zu lange Operator-Namen in der Konfiguration wurden falsch gekuerzt.
  - kleine Anpassung an AIX 3.2.5: nun laeuft der ngIRCd auch dort :-)
  - ADMIN-Befehl implementiert. Die Daten hierzu werden in der Konfig-Datei
    im [Global]-Abschnitt mit den Variablen "AdminInfo1", "AdminInfo2" und
    "AdminEMail" konfiguriert.

ngIRCd 0.4.3, 11.06.2002

  - Bei PRIVMSG und NOTICE hat der ngIRCd nicht ueberpruft, ob das Ziel
    ueberhaupt ein User ist. War es keiner, so fuehrte dies zu einem
    Abbruch des Servers [es wurde assert() aufgerufen].

ngIRCd 0.4.2, 29.04.2002

  - LUSERS verzaehlt sich bei eigenen Server-Links nicht mehr.
  - QUIT wird nun auch von noch nicht registrierten Clients akzeptiert.
  - IRC-Funktion LIST implementiert; bisher werden allerdings noch keine
    Wildcards (bis auf "*") unterstuetzt.

ngIRCd 0.4.1, 08.04.2002

  - Bei Server-Links wird nicht mehr an Hand der Anzahl der Parameter
    eines empfangenen SERVER-Befehls, sondern "intern" erkannt, ob es
    sich um eine ein- oder ausgehende Verbindung handelt und somit das
    eigene PASS-SERVER-Paar gesendet werden muss oder nicht. Da sich
    verschiedene Versionen des Original-ircd's anders verhalten, schlug
    die Anmeldung je nach Gehenseite evtl. fehl.
  - Bei einem NICK-Befehl eines lokalen Client konnte der Server ab-
    stuerzen, da ein Format-String einer Log-Meldung fehlerhaft war.

ngIRCd 0.4.0, 01.04.2002

  - IRC-Befehle nochmal auf weitere Source-Dateien aufgespalten.
  - WHO implementiert (bisher ohne komplette Unterstuetzung von Masks).
  - Der AWAY-Mode wurde nicht ueber mehrere Server-Links weitergegeben.
  - stderr wird nun in eine Datei umgelenkt (/tmp/ngircd-<PID>.err).
    Laeuft der Server nicht im Debug-Modus, so wird diese bei Programm-
    ende geloescht. Sollte der Server abstuerzen, finden sich hier evtl.
    zusaetzliche Informationen.
  - In Nicknames wird das Zeichen "-" nun als zulaessig erkannt.
  - die Beispiel-Konfigurationsdatei (doc/sample-ngircd.conf) wird als
    ngircd.conf installiert, wenn noch keine "echte" Konfigurationsdatei
    vorhanden ist.
  - bei WHO, WHOIS und NAMES wird nun nur noch der Status "Operator" oder
    "voiced" geliefert -- nicht mehr beides.
  - Server-Gruppen implementiert: es wird immer nur zu einem Server in
    einer Gruppe eine Verbindung aufgebaut, klappt es beim ersten Server
    nicht, so wird der naechste probiert (Variable "Group" in der Kon-
    figurationsdatei, Sektion [Server]).
  - IRC_PING() ist, wenn nicht im "strict RFC"-Mode, toleranter und ak-
    zeptiert beliebig viele Parameter (z.B. BitchX sendet soetwas).
  - die "Portab-Header" werden nicht mehr benoetigt, die System-Erkennung
    wird nun ausschliesslich vom configure-Script durchgefuehrt. System-
    abhaengige Definitionen finden sich nun unter src/portrab/.
  - Clients und Channels werden nicht mehr ueber ihren Namen, sondern
    einen Hash-Wert gesucht: sollte deutlich schneller sein.
  - neuer Kommandozeilen-Parameter "--configtest": die Konfiguration wird
    gelesen und dann die verwendeten Werte angezeigt.
  - Client-Mode "s" (Server Notices) implementiert.
  - mit dem neuen Kommandozeilen-Parameter "--config"/"-f" kann eine
    alternative Konfigurationsdatei angegeben werden.
  - nach dem Start kann der ngIRCd, wenn er mit root-Rechten laeuft,
    zu einer anderen User-ID und Group-ID wechseln.
  - URL der Homepage wird u.a. bei "--version" mit angezeigt.

ngIRCd 0.3.0, 02.03.2002

  - bekommt der Server ein HUP-Signal, so startet er neu -- genau so, wie
    er auf den IRC-Befehl RESTART reagiert.
  - FAQ um Hinweise auf den Bugtracker erweitert.
  - neuer Kommandozeilen-Schalter "--passive" (-p): wird er angegeben, so
    verbindet sich der ngIRCd nicht mehr automatisch zu anderen Servern.
    Zum Debuggen manchmal ganz praktisch :-)
  - direkt nach dem Start schreibt der ngIRCd nun die aktiven Kommando-
    zeilenschalter in's Logfile (Passive, Debug, Sniffer ...).
  - das Signal-Flag SA_RESTART wird nur noch gesetzt, wenn es auf dem
    jeweiligen System auch definiert ist.
  - bei ausgehenden Verbindungen wird nun der Ziel-Port protokolliert.
  - neue Befehle VERSION und KILL implementiert.
  - make-Target "check" (und "distcheck") mit Sinn erfuellt :-)
    (die Tests sind aber bisher nicht all zu tiefgehend ...)
  - Durch einen Ueberlauf konnte die Idle-Time bei WHOIS negativ werden ...
  - Anpassungen an A/UX: gehoert nun auch zu den unterstuetzten Platformen.
  - WHOIS wird nicht mehr automatisch an den "Original-Server" weiterge-
    leitet: war eh nicht RFC-konform und machte mit Clients Probleme.
  - an User wird nun immer ein "komplettes" Prefix (mit Host-Mask) ver-
    schickt, Server bekommen nach wie vor kurze: das "Original" hat bei
    bestimmten Befehlen (PRIVMSG) ansonsten evtl. Probleme ...
  - NAMES korrigiert und vollstaendig implementiert.
  - SQUIT wird auf jeden Fall geforwarded, zudem besseres Logging.
  - Ist ein Nick bei der User-Registrierung bereits belegt, nimmt der
    Server nun korrekt weitere NICK-Befehle an und verwendet diese.
  - PRIVMSG beachtet nun die Channel-Modes "n" und "m".
  - AWAY implementiert. PRIVMSG, MODE, USERHOST und WHOIS angepasst.
  - der ngIRCd unterstuetzt nun Channel-Topics (TOPIC-Befehl).
  - ausgehende Server-Verbindungen werden nun asynchron connectiert und
    blockieren nicht mehr den ganzen Server, wenn die Gegenseite nicht
    erreicht werden kann (bis zum Timeout konnten Minuten vergehen!).
  - Wert der Konfigurations-Variable "ConnectRetry" wird besser beachtet.
  - Channel- und Nicknames werden nun ordentlich validiert.

ngIRCd 0.2.1, 17.02.2002

  - NICK korrigiert: es werden nun auch alle "betroffenen" User informiert.
  - configure-Script erweitert, u.a. bessere Anpassung an BeOS: dort wird
    nun die "libbe" zum ngIRCd gelinkt, somit funktioniert auch syslog.
  - Fehlerhafte bzw. noch nicht verstandene Modes werden nun ausfuehrlicher
    an den Client geliefert.

ngIRCd 0.2.0, 15.02.2002

  - Nicknames und Channel-Namen werden etwas besser auf Gueltigkeit ueber-
    prueft; ist aber nach wie vor noch nicht ausreichend.
  - NJOINS von Servern wurden nicht an andere Server weitergeleitet.
  - Begonnen Channel-Modes und User-Channel-Modes zu implementieren: der
    Server versteht an User-Modes o und v, beachtet letzteres allerdings
    noch nirgends. Bekannte (aber nicht beachtete!) Channel-Modes sind
    bisher a, m, n, p, q, s und t. Diese Modes werden von Usern ange-
    nommen, von anderen Servern werden auch unbekannte Modes uebernommen.
  - Benutzer von connectierenden Servern wurden nicht in den Channels ange-
    kuendigt, es wurden nur die internen Strukturen angepasst.
  - Nach dem Connect eines Users werden LUSERS-Informationen angezeigt.

ngIRCd 0.1.0, 29.01.2002

  - User-Modes bei User-Registrierungen von andere Servern (NICK-Befehl)
    wurden falsch uebernommen. Zudem wurden die Modes falsch gekuerzt.
  - Server-Verbindungen werden nun nach dem Start erst nach einer kurzen
    Pause aufgebaut (zur Zeit drei Sekunden).
  - Hilfetext korrigiert: --help und --version waren vertauscht, die
    Option --sniffer wurde gar nicht erwaehnt.
  - FAQ.txt in doc/ begonnen.
  - der IRC-Sniffer wird nur noch aktiviert, wenn die Option auf der
    Kommandozeile angegeben wurde (bei entsprechend compiliertem Server).
  - Channels implementiert, bisher jedoch noch ohne Channel-Modes, d.h.
    es gibt keine Channel-Ops, kein Topic, kein "topic lock" etc. pp.
    Chatten in Channels ist aber natuerlich moeglich ;-)
  - neue Befehle fuer Channles: JOIN, PART und NJOIN.
  - durch die Channels einige Aenderungen an PRIVMSG, WHOIS, MODE etc.
  - neu connectierenden Servern werden nun Channels mit NJOIN angekuendigt.
  - Signal-Hander geaendert: die Fehlermeldung "interrupted system call"
    sollte so nicht mehr auftreten.
  - "spaeter" neu connectierende Server werden nun im Netz angekuendigt.
  - SERVER-Meldungen an andere Server sind nun korrekt sortiert.
  - Clients werden nun korrekt sowohl nur ueber den Nickname als auch die
    komplette "Host Mask" erkannt.

ngIRCd 0.0.3, 16.01.2002

  - Server-Links vollstaendig implementiert: der ngIRCd kann nun auch
    "Sub-Server" haben, also sowohl als Leaf-Node als auch Hub in einem
    IRC-Netzwerk arbeiten.
  - MODE und NICK melden nun die Aenderungen an andere Server, ebenso
    die Befehle QUIT und SQUIT.
  - WHOIS wird nun immer an den "Original-Server" weitergeleitet.
  - Parses handhabt Leerzeichen zw. Parametern nun etwas "lockerer".
  - Status-Codes an den Server selber werden ignorier.
  - Log-Meldungen und Log-Level ueberarbeitet und korrigiert.
  - Kommandozeilen-Parser: Debug- und No-Daemon-Modus, Hilfe.
  - ngIRCd wandelt sich nun in einen Daemon (Hintergrundprozess) um.
  - WHOIS korrigiert: Anfrage wurde u.U. an User geforwarded anstatt vom
    Server beantwortet zu werden.
  - neue Befehle: LUSERS, LINKS
  - Client-Modes von Remote-Servern wurden nicht korrekt uerbernommen.

ngIRCd 0.0.2, 06.01.2002

  - Struktur der Konfigurationsdatei geaendert: sie ist nun "Samba like",
    d.h. sie besteht aus Abschnitten (siehe "doc/sample-ngircd.conf").
  - Es koennen mehrere IRC-Server-Opertatoren konfiguriert werden.
  - Zombies der Resolver-Prozesse werden nun ordentlich "getoetet".
  - NICK kann nun die Gross- und Kleinschreibung eines Nicks aendern.
  - ein Server-Passwort ist nun konfigurierbar.
  - neue Befehle: ERROR, SERVER, NJOIN (nur als "Fake"), SQUIT.
  - Asynchroner Resolver Hostname->IP implementiert.
  - Server-Links teilweise implementiert: bisher kann der ngIRCd jedoch
    nur "leafed server" sein, d.h. keine "Client-Server" haben. Einige
    Befehle sind auch noch nicht (optimal) angepasst: PRIVMSG funktioniert
    aber bereits, ebenso wie WHOIS (letzterer wird immer an den Server,
    auf dem der User registriert ist, weitergegeben).
  - "arpa/inet.h" wird nur noch includiert, wenn vorhanden.
  - Fehler bei select() fuerhen nun zum Abbruch von ngIRCd, bisher landete
    der Server zumeist in einer Endlosschleife.
  - Logmeldungen und Level an vielen Stellen verbessert.
  - lokalen Usernamen wird nun ein "~" vorangestellt, da bisher noch keine
    Ident-Anfragen gemacht werden.

ngIRCd 0.0.1, 31.12.2001

  - erste oeffentliche Version von ngIRCd als "public preview" :-)
