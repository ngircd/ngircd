# This is a sample configuration file for the ngIRCd, which must be adepted
# to the local preferences and needs.

# Comments are started with "#" or ";".
#
# Use "ngircd --configtest" (see manual page ngircd(8)) to validate that the
# server interpreted the configuration file as expected!
#

[Global]
	# The [Global] section of this file is used to define the main
	# configuration of the server, like the server name and the ports
	# on which the server should be listening.
	
	# Server name in the IRC network, must contain at least one dot
	# (".") and be unique in the IRC network. Required!
	Name = irc.the.net
	
	# Info text of the server. This will be shown by WHOIS and
	# LINKS requests for example.
	Info = Server Info Text

	# so the server listens on all IP addresses of the system)
	;Listen = 1.2.3.4
	
	# Text file with the "message of the day" (MOTD). This message will
	# be shown to all users connecting to the server:
	;MotdFile = /usr/local/etc/ngircd.motd

	# A simple Phrase (<256 chars) if you don't want to use a motd file.
	# If it is set no MotdFile will be read at all.
	;MotdPhrase = "Hello world!"

	# User ID under which the server should run; you can use the name
	# of the user or the numerical ID. ATTENTION: For this to work the
	# server must have been started with root privileges! In addition,
	# the configuration and MOTD files must be readable by this user,
	# otherwise RESTART and REHASH won't work!
	;ServerUID = 65534

	# seconds, it will be disconnected by the server.

[Server]
	# Other servers are configured in [Server] sections. If you
	# configure a port for the connection, then this ngircd tries to
	# connect to to the other server on the given port; if not it waits
	# for the other server to connect.
	# There may be more than one server block.
	#
	# Server Groups:
	# The ngIRCd allows "server groups": You can assign an "ID" to every
	# server with which you want this ngIRCd to link. If a server of a
	# group won't answer, the ngIRCd tries to connect to the next server
	# in the given group. But the ngircd never tries to connect to two
	# servers with the same group ID.
	
	# IRC name of the server
	;Name = irc2.the.net
   
	# Internet host name of the peer

[Channel]
	# Pre-defined channels can be configured in [Channel] sections.
	# Such channels are created by the server when starting up and even
	# persist when there are no more members left.
	# Persistent channels are marked with the mode 'P', which can be set
	# and unset by IRC operators like other modes on the fly.
	# There may be more than one [Channel] block.
	
	# Name of the channel

	# Topic for this channel
