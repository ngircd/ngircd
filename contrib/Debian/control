Description: A lightweight daemon for the Internet Relay Chat (IRC)
 ngIRCd is a free open source daemon for the Internet Relay Chat (IRC)

 This package contains the "standard distribution", including support for
 syslog logging and compressed server-links using zlib.
 .
 Advantages of ngIRCd:
  - no problems with servers using changing/non-static IP addresses.
  - small and lean configuration file.
  - free, modern and open source C code.
  - still under active development.
 .
 ngIRCd is compatible to the "original" ircd 2.10.3p3, so you can run
 mixed networks.
