This document lists the different user modes, channel modes, and channel
user modes that ngIRCd supports.


I. User Modes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

User modes are attributes a user has in the network, regardless of the
channels he is using at the moment.

  mode	since	description

  a	0.3.0	User is away.
  c	17	IRC operator wants to receive connect/disconnect NOTICEs.

  x	17	Hostname of this user is "cloaked".

II. Channel Modes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Channel modes are attributes of specific channels which are valid for all
users joined (or trying to join) to this channel. Some modes add and remove
users to lists (e.g. "invite list", "ban list"), others have parameters
(like "channel key"), most are simple flags (like "moderated").

  i	0.5.0	Channel is "invite only".
  I	0.5.0	Add/remove a host mask to the invite list.
  k	0.6.0	Channel has a "key" (a password).
  l	0.6.0	Channel has a user limit.
  m	0.3.0	Channel is moderated, only "voiced" users can send messages.
  n	0.3.0	Channel doesn't allow messages of users not being members.
  O	18	Only IRC operators are allowed to join this channel.
  P	0.5.0	Channel is "persistent".
  r (1)	19	Channel is "registered" (e.g. by ChanServ).
  R	19	Only registered users are allowed to join this channel.
  s	0.9.0	Channel is "secret".
  t	0.3.0	Only ChanOps are allowed to modify the channel topic.
  z	16	Only users connected via SSL are allowed to join the channel.

III. Channel User Modes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Channel user modes are attributes that a particular user has in a specific
channel of which he is a member.

  mode	since	description

  o	0.2.0	User is channel operator and can op/kick/... other members.
  v	0.2.0	User is "voiced" and can speak even if channel is moderated.


Notes
~~~~~

(1) This mode is not set by ngIRCd itself but by services. ngIRCd handles
    the mode transparently and possibly adjusts its behaviour.
