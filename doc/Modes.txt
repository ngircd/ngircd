This document lists the different user modes, channel modes, and channel
user modes that ngIRCd supports.

II. Channel Modes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Channel modes are attributes of specific channels which are valid for all
users joined (or trying to join) to this channel. Some modes add and remove
users to lists (e.g. "invite list", "ban list"), others have parameters
(like "channel key"), most are simple flags (like "moderated").

III. Channel User Modes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Channel user modes are attributes that a particular user has in a specific
channel of which he is a member.

Notes
~~~~~

(1) This mode is not set by ngIRCd itself but by services. ngIRCd handles
    the mode transparently and possibly adjusts its behaviour.
