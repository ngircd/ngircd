I. Introduction
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

ngIRCd is an Open Source server for the Internet Relay Chat (IRC), which
is developed and published under the terms of the GNU General Public
Licence, see the file COPYING for details. ngIRCd means "next generation
IRC daemon" (which is a little bit exaggerated, "lightweight Internet Relay
Chat server" would be better), it's written from scratch and not deduced
from the "grandfather of IRC daemons", the daemon of the IRCNet.

Please see the INSTALL document for installation and upgrade information!


II. Status
~~~~~~~~~~~

It is not the goal of ngIRCd to implement all the nasty behaviours of the
original ircd, but to implement most of the useful commands and semantics
specified by the RFCs.

In the meantime ngIRCd should be quite feature complete and stable to be
used in real IRC networks.

Implemented IRC-commands are:

ADMIN, AWAY, CHANINFO, CONNECT, DIE, DISCONNECT, ERROR, GLINE, HELP, INFO,
INVITE, ISON, JOIN, KICK, KILL, KLINE, LINKS, LIST, LUSERS, MODE, MOTD,
NAMES, NICK, NJOIN, NOTICE, OPER, PART, PASS, PING, PONG, PRIVMSG, QUIT,
REHASH, RESTART, SERVER, SERVICE, SERVLIST, SQUERY, SQUIT, STATS, SUMMON,
TIME, TOPIC, TRACE, USER, USERHOST, USERS, VERSION, WALLOPS, WEBIRC, WHO,
WHOIS, WHOWAS.

III. Features (or: why use ngIRCd?)

- no problems with servers which have dynamic IP addresses
