I. Introduction
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

ngIRCd is an Open Source server for the Internet Relay Chat (IRC), which
is developed and published under the terms of the GNU General Public
Licence (URL: http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl.html). ngIRCd means "next
generation IRC daemon", it's written from scratch and not deduced from the
"grandfather of IRC daemons", the daemon of the IRCNet.


II. Status
~~~~~~~~~~~

It is not the goal of ngIRCd to implement all the nasty behaviours of the
original ircd, but to implement most of the useful commands and semantics
specified by the RFCs.

In the meantime ngIRCd should be quite feature complete and stable to be
used in real IRC networks.

Implemented IRC-commands are:

ADMIN, AWAY, CHANINFO, CONNECT, DIE, DISCONNECT, ERROR, HELP, INVITE, ISON,
JOIN, KICK, KILL, LINKS, LIST, LUSERS, MODE, MOTD, NAMES, NICK, NJOIN, NOTICE,
OPER, PART, PASS, PING, PONG, PRIVMSG, QUIT, REHASH, RESTART, SERVER, SQUIT,
STATS, TIME, TOPIC, TRACE, USER, USERHOST, VERSION, WHO, WHOIS, WHOWAS.


III. Features (or: why use ngIRCd?)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- no problems with servers which have dynamic IP addresses
- simple, easy understandable configuration file,
- freely published open-source C source code,
- ngIRCd will be developed on in the future.
- wide field of supported platforms, including AIX, A/UX, FreeBSD, HP-UX,
  IRIX, Linux, Mac OS X, NetBSD, OpenBSD, Solaris, and Windows with Cygwin.
